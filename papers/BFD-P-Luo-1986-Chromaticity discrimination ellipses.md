# Chromaticity-Discrimination Ellipses for Surface Colours

Available colour-discrimination data for surface colours have been analysed to produce chromaticity-discrimination ellipses for individual colour centres. Applying simulated errors showed that when the distribution of samples around a standard was unsatisfactory, the ellipses obtained were unreliable. A total of 132 reliable ellipses were obtained. The values of  $ \theta $  and a/b varied systematically over the chromaticity diagram, the patterns from acceptability, perceptibility, textile, and non-textile ellipses being very similar. New experimental data involving over 400 pairs of samples corresponding to 70 of the colour centres and assessed against a grey scale were used to adjust the relative sizes of the ellipses. Overall set factors were used to bring data from different sources onto a common scale. However, even after allowing for different lightness levels, the sizes of the ellipses still appeared to be irregular. Using the new results to adjust the sizes of the individual ellipses from any one group of data, e.g., BFD, DF, or MMB, gave ellipses forming a much more regular pattern. In contrast to the MacAdam ellipses, the smallest ellipses occurred in the blue-grey region. Our results imply that the relative sizes of the ellipses from the same group of data are in error by a factor of two or more. Comparing colour differences for different colours appears to be much more difficult than has been previously realised. The problem appears to have affected all the major groups of published data.

## I ntroduction

The results of experiments on colour discrimination can be conveniently summarised and compared as chromaticity-discrimination ellipses. In previous studies $ ^{1-15} $  in most cases only data from a single source have been considered and the number of ellipses has been relatively small, although

Friele $ ^{3} $  did combine data from six different studies to give 52 ellipsoids. (Friele considered colour discrimination in three dimensions; the present study is restricted to the x, y plane). Kuehni also combined data from different studies and produced a chromaticity plot containing 52 ellipses.

Combining or comparing ellipses from different sources is complicated by factors such as the use of different visual scales, the use of different substrates, and the use of different levels of luminance factor Y. Visual results based on ratio, ranking, and pair-comparison experiments $ ^{2-7,9} $  (in which differences are only compared with other differences in the same series of experiments), category experiments $ ^{1} $  (in which differences are assigned to categories such as “just noticeable difference” or “fairly large difference”), and acceptability experiments $ ^{10-15} $  (in which samples are judged to be acceptable or not acceptable as matches to a standard) are all on different scales. In some cases results from one scale should be directly proportional to those from another scale, but the proportionality constant is unknown and must be determined. However, there is no simple relationship between results from acceptability experiments and any of the other results. In different acceptability experiments the panels of observers may well be working to different tolerance limits.

The basic aim of the present work was to use data from all suitable sources to produce a self-consistent set of ellipses. New experiments have been carried out to overcome the problems mentioned above. Briefly, the basic problem is the relative size of the ellipses. The axial ratios a/b and values of tilt angle  $ \theta $  may well be correct, but the sizes depend on the visual scales. (Although Wyszecki $ ^{16} $  has shown that both a/b and  $ \theta $  can change from one observer to another, all the data considered here are based on average results from a number of observers.) However, if one pair of samples corresponding to each of two colour centres is assessed on the same visual scale, in principle the sizes of ellipses for these centres can be adjusted, one relative to the other. Sample pairs corresponding to colour centres previously

studied have been prepared and assessed by a grey-scale method. Particular attention has also been paid to the reliability of the ellipses. $ ^{18} $ 

## Preparation and Measurement of Samples

Samples were produced by dyeing plain wool serge (as supplied by the Society of Dyers and Colourists for use in washfastness tests) with acid dyes. Sample pairs were produced close to seventy of the colour centres previous studied, for which a chromaticity-discrimination ellipse could be obtained. Sample pairs were also prepared at a further twenty centres which were close in chromaticity to five of the centres previously studied, but different in values of Y. For each centre three to ten pairs were prepared, with at least one pair along each of the major and minor axes of the corresponding ellipse. In every case the difference was essentially a chromaticity difference, i.e., the difference in Y was very small, and the pairs were nonmetameric. In all, 413 sample pairs were produced.

The samples were mounted (four layers) on stiff white card, each sample being three inches square. Tristimulus values for illuminant  $ D_{65} $  and the 1964 standard observer were calculated from reflectance values obtained using a Macbeth MS-2000 spectrophotometer. When producing samples to correspond to the Davidson and Friede, $ ^{11} $  JK, $ ^{14} $  VVVR, $ ^{3} $  and W $ ^{10} $  centres, tristimulus values were also obtained for illuminant C and the 1931 standard observer to compare with the original measurements. Similarly for Morley, Munn, and Billmeyer $ ^{1} $  centres, tristimulus values were also obtained for their illuminant M. However, in any subsequent calculations, the illuminant  $ D_{65} $  data were used.

Measurements were made before, during, and after the visual assessments. For each pair of samples, the standard deviation of the  $ \Delta x $ ,  $ \Delta y $ , and  $ \Delta Y $  values were calculated. The means of these standard deviations were 0.00013, 0.00013, and 0.05, respectively, indicating that the measurement repeatability was good and also that the samples did not change appreciably during the experiments.

For some pairs, calculations were also carried out using the illuminant M distribution, which is close to that used as the source for the visual assessments. The  $ \Delta x $  and  $ \Delta y $  values differed from those obtained for illuminant  $ D_{65} $  by only 2%, on average.

## V isual Assessments

Visual assessments were carried out over a period of months using a Verivide viewing cabinet.⁶ A 5-ft "Artificial Daylight" fluorescent tube conforming to British Standard 950, 1967, was used to simulate illuminant  $ D_{65} $  and the grey matt-paint background had x, y, and Y coordinates of 0.299, 0.323, and 14.2, respectively. A panel of twenty observers was used. All had normal color vision according to the Ishihara test.

Each sample pair was assessed against a grey scale. The grey scale was similar to that used in fastness testing for assessing change of colour, $ ^{19} $  except that the samples were

of the same size and material as the samples being assessed. The CIELAB coordinates of the grey-scale samples are given in Table I.

Samples 1 to 4 were lighter than the standard, the measured differences increasing from Grade 5 to Grade 1. The samples were all essentially neutral and the  $ \Delta L^{*} $  values were almost exactly equal to the  $ \Delta E^{*}_{ab} $  (hereafter,  $ \Delta E $ ) values.

The samples were arranged as shown in Fig. 1, except that the sample pair and grey-scale pair were interchanged in a random manner during the assessments. Similarly, the samples in a pair were interchanged (left and right) and the pairs were presented in a different random order for each observer. The observer was asked to pick a sample from the grey scale, put it alongside the standard (STD), and compare the difference with that for the sample pair. Different grey-scale samples were tried until the one giving a difference from STD closest in magnitude to that for the sample pair was found. The observers were encouraged to give intermediate grades when possible, e.g., 2.8 if the difference between the sample pair was slightly larger than that between STD and "3."

After the assessments, the mean grey-scale rating (GS) for each pair was calculated. The GS values are obviously not proportional to the differences seen, but the corresponding  $ \Delta E $  values should be. From Table I, a pair with a GS value of 2 should correspond to a visual difference about twice as large as the visual difference for a pair with a GS

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl//9cb49690-069d-4e4e-bc7e-b1a742769de7/markdown_1/imgs/img_in_image_box_613_1055_1126_1461.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2025-12-30T04%3A23%3A04Z%2F-1%2F%2F7af37fc16b21277514bc1f03abe7b2afdbd8e7abaa7812874715ef7a14ae51f2" alt="Image" width="41%" /></div>

value of 3 (equivalent  $ \Delta E $  values of 6.2 and 3.0 respectively). Thus an equation was required to relate the Grades and  $ \Delta E $  values in Table I over the range Grade 5 to Grade 2, since the GS values ranged from 4.7 to 2.0. Using a standard computer curve-fitting package provided by the University Computer Centre, it was found that the equation

 $$ \Delta E=-1.078+23.56e^{-Grade/1.709} $$ 

gave  $ \Delta E $  values corresponding exactly to those given in Table I for Grades 2 to 5. Hence the equation

 $$ \Delta V=-1.078+23.56e^{-GS/1.709} $$ 

was used to convert the GS values into  $ \Delta V $  values which should be directly proportional to the differences seen, and equal in magnitude to CIELAB  $ \Delta E $  units. Since CIELAB  $ \Delta L^{*} $ ,  $ \Delta C^{*} $  and  $ \Delta H^{*} $  units may not be the same it might be better to regard the  $ \Delta V $  values as being in CIELAB  $ \Delta L^{*} $  units. In any case the link with CIELAB units gives a reasonable guide to the magnitude of the differences.

The grey-scale method was preferred to the ratio method used previously, $ ^{6} $  partly because it enables results obtained at different times to be compared directly, i.e., all results are obtained on a common scale which can be reproduced. In addition, it was considered easier for the observers to compare differences between, say, a pair of red samples and a pair of grey samples rather than a pair of green samples as might happen in ratio experiments.

The mean CIELAB $\Delta E$ of the pairs was about 3.5 with 80% of the pairs having values in the range 3 to 4.

## Sources of Published Data Used

Brief details of the data groups used are given below.

VVVR. $ ^{3} $  Twenty sample pairs around each of 10 colour centres were made using gloss paint and assessed by 14 observers using a pair-comparison method and by 15 to 25 observers using an acceptability method. The pair-comparison results have been used in this paper. The mean  $ \Delta E $  (CIELAB) was 0.9.

BFD. $ ^{6} $  Seven to 25 sample pairs around each of 42 colour centres were made using gloss paint (30 centres) and textiles (12 centres) and assessed by about 20 observers using a ratio method. Ratio comparisons between pairs from different centres were used to adjust the results onto a common visual scale. Mean  $ \Delta E = 2.3 $ .

MMB. $ ^{1} $  Twenty-two to 30 sample pairs around each of 19 colour centres were made using printing inks coated on tin plate and assessed twice by 20 observers using a category (1–6) method. Mean  $ \Delta E = 5.2 $ .

CISCC. $ ^{2} $  Twenty-nine to 30 sample pairs around each of 6 colour centres were made using matt paint (4 centres) and textiles (2 centres) and assessed by 26 to 37 observers using three different methods. The results of Scale 1 (ranking method) have been used. Mean  $ \Delta E = 2.1 $ . Textile samples corresponding to the same 6 centres were also made by Elamin. $ ^{9} $  The 14 to 19 sample pairs for each colour centre were assessed by 20 observers using a ratio-comparison method. Mean  $ \Delta E = 2.5 $ . The two sets of results for each colour centre have been combined together.

CIE. $ ^{7} $  Fifty-nine to 68 sample pairs around each of the colour centres recommended by the CIE guidelines $ ^{8} $  were made using textiles and assessed by 20 observers using a ratio method. Ratio comparisons between pairs from different centres and grey-scale assessments were used to adjust the results onto a common scale. Mean  $ \Delta E = 2.9 $ .

STROCKA. $ ^{5} $  Fifty-one textile sample pairs around the CIE red centre $ ^{8} $  were assessed (main series) twice by 20 observers and four times by 14 observers using a pair-comparison method. Mean  $ \Delta E = 2.0 $ .

WITT. $ ^{4} $  Sixty-seven gloss-paint sample pairs around the CIE green centre $ ^{8} $  were assessed four times by 23 to 25 observers using an absolute-threshold method and a pair-comparison method with a common standard pair (Series 2—used here).  $ \Delta E = 0.1 $  to 1.9.

DF. $ ^{11} $  Fifteen textile sample pairs around each of 19 colour centres were assessed at least three times by 8 observers using the acceptability method. Mean  $ \Delta E = 1.7 $ .

MCD. $ ^{15} $  Eleven or 12 polyester sewing-thread sample pairs around each of 55 colour centres were assessed five times by 8 observers using the acceptability method. Mean  $ \Delta E = 3.2 $ . The set numbers in the present article run from 4 to 58 rather than 1 to 55, and therefore MCD 6, for example, corresponds to set 3 in McDonald's paper.

K. $ ^{12} $  Thirty-five textile sample pairs around each of 3 colour centres were assessed by 10 observers using the acceptability method. Mean  $ \Delta E = 1.8 $ .

KMET. $ ^{13} $  Eighteen textile sample pairs around each of 10 colour centres were assessed by 16 observers using the acceptability method. Mean  $ \Delta E = 1.8 $ .

JK. $ ^{14} $  Nineteen to 86 various types of textile sample pairs around each of 12 colour centres were assessed twice by 24 observers using the acceptability method. For each colour centre two or more of the original data sets corresponding to the same colour have been combined together. Mean  $ \Delta E = 1.9 $ .

W. $ ^{10} $  Forty-two to 95 textile sample pairs around each of 5 colour centres (4 corresponding to DF, J, N, Q, and S) were assessed by 30 observers using the acceptability method. Mean  $ \Delta E = 1.8 $ .

## Calculation of Chromaticity-Discrimination Ellipses

Colour discrimination at any one colour centre can be represented by the equation

 $$ \begin{aligned}g_{11}\Delta x^{2}+2g_{12}\Delta x\Delta y+g_{22}\Delta y^{2}+2g_{13}\Delta x\Delta Y\\+2g_{23}\Delta y\Delta Y+g_{33}\Delta Y^{2}=\Delta E^{2}\end{aligned} $$ 

For constant  $ \Delta E $  the equation defines the surface of an ellipsoid, while the cross section of the ellipsoid in the plane  $ \Delta Y = 0 $  gives the chromaticity-discrimination ellipse. Two somewhat different methods of calculation were used depending on the form of the visual data.

## Method 1

For most of the perceptibility data, the visual results are represented by  $ \Delta V $  values which are intended to be directly proportional to the differences seen. (For the MMB data the visual results are on a linear scale, but  $ \Delta V = 0 $  does not correspond to  $ \Delta E = 0 $ . Plots of  $ \Delta E $  against  $ \Delta V $  for individual colour centres showed that the addition of 1.5 to the original  $ \Delta V $  values was required.) The problem was to calculate, from the experimental data for any one colour centre, the  $ g_{jk} $  values in eq. (3) giving the best agreement between the  $ \Delta E $  values and the  $ \Delta V $  values, i.e., to minimise  $ \Sigma (\Delta V - \Delta E)^{2} $ . The procedure used was similar to that used by Friele $ ^{3} $  and by Wardman. $ ^{10} $ 

If we define  $ S^{2} $  by

 $$ S^{2}\;=\;\Sigma(\Delta V^{2}\;-\;\Delta E^{2})^{2}W $$ 

where W is a weighting factor to be discussed below, combining eqs. (3) and (4) gives

 $$ \begin{aligned}S^{2}=\Sigma(\Delta V^{2}-g_{11}\Delta x^{2}-2g_{12}\Delta x\Delta y-g_{22}\Delta y^{2}\\-2g_{13}\Delta x\Delta Y-2g_{23}\Delta y\Delta Y-g_{33}\Delta Y^{2})^{2}W\end{aligned} $$ 

Setting the partial derivative of  $ S^{2} $  with respect to  $ g_{11} $  equal to zero gives

 $$ \begin{aligned}\Sigma(\Delta V^{2}-g_{11}\Delta x^{2}-2g_{12}\Delta x\Delta y-g_{22}\Delta y^{2}\\-2g_{13}\Delta x\Delta Y-2g_{23}\Delta y\Delta Y-g_{33}\Delta Y^{2})\Delta x^{2}W=0\end{aligned} $$ 

Differentiating partially with respect to  $ g_{12}, \ldots, g_{33} $  gives a further five equations which, together with eq. (6), can be solved for  $ g_{11} $  to  $ g_{33} $ .

Inspection of eq. (4) shows that if

 $$ W\;=\;\Sigma\;\frac{1}{(\Delta V\;+\;\Delta E)^{2}} $$ 

then

 $$ \begin{aligned}S^{2}&=\Sigma\frac{(\Delta V^{2}-\Delta E^{2})^{2}}{(\Delta V+\Delta E)^{2}}\\&=\Sigma(\Delta V-\Delta E)^{2}\end{aligned} $$ 

which is the sum to be minimised.

In the actual calculations, W was taken initially to be  $ 1/\Delta V^{2} $  for each pair. The resulting g values were then used to calculate  $ \Delta E $  values and an improved estimate of W from eq. (7). The process was repeated, usually about ten times, until constant g values were obtained.

For several colour centres the results were compared with those obtained from computer programs using different methods $ ^{6,7} $  of minimising the sum of squares of the differences between the  $ \Delta V $  and  $ \Delta E $  values. The results agreed very well. The a and b values rarely differed by more than 5% while the  $ \theta $  values agreed to within  $ 2^{\circ} $ . The ellipse parameters corresponding to  $ \Delta E = 1 $  were calculated from the g values in the usual way.

## Method 2

For the acceptability data $ ^{10-15} $  and some of the perceptibility data, $ ^{4,5} $  the visual assessments were carried out using

<div style="text-align: center;">TABLE II. Comparison of results for CIE green centre.</div>

what can be regarded as "two-category" methods, i.e., in acceptability experiments the observers placed a pair difference in one of the categories "acceptable" or "not acceptable," while in Witt and Döring's work $ ^{4} $  the categories "difference perceptible" and "difference not perceptible" were used (series 1). The relationship between the percent acceptable and the  $ \Delta E $  values is likely to be S-shaped rather than linear.

Stocka $ ^{5} $  used the function

 $$ P=\frac{1}{1+\mathrm{e}^{\alpha-\Delta E}} $$ 

where P is the fraction of differences in the second (larger) category and  $ \alpha $  is a constant for a particular set of data at one colour centre, to relate the visual results to the  $ \Delta E $  values. The sum of squares of the differences between the calculated and experimental P values was minimised. This method is denoted by 2a below.

Rich et al. $ ^{20} $  used a Gaussian density function

 $$ A\;=\;(1\;-\;\beta)\;{\bf e}^{\left(\frac{-\Delta E^{2}}{2}\right)} $$ 

where A is the fraction of differences in the first (smaller) category and  $ \beta $  is a false-alarm probability. The g (and  $ \beta $ ) values giving the minimum sum of squares of the differences between the experimental and calculated A values were determined (Method 2b).

For Methods 2a and 2b a quasi-Newton algorithmic minimisation method $ ^{21,22} $  provided by the Bradford University Computer Centre was used. The ellipses parameters obtained for P (or A) = 0.5 are compared with those obtained by Witt and Döring $ ^{4} $  for their series 1 results for the CIE green centre in Table II. Since the method of calculation used by Witt and Döring was different from either of our methods, the agreement is very satisfactory. It was decided to use Method 2a for all the data for which Method 2 was appropriate, since this method has been recommended by the CIE. $ ^{8} $ 

Ellipse calculations were attempted for 188 colour centres, and ellipses were obtained in 164 cases. In the other cases, the "best" g values led to negative values for  $ \Delta E^{2} $ ; this can happen if  $ g_{12}^{2} < g_{11}g_{22} $ .

## Reliability of the Ellipses

Alder $ ^{18} $  has described a method whereby the reliability of chromaticity-discrimination ellipses can be tested, and has shown that in many cases the ellipses obtained are unreliable. The basic idea is to alter the experimental data used to calculate the ellipses by small amounts simulating the estimated experimental errors. If an ellipse calculated from

the simulated data differs greatly from that calculated from the original experimental data, the ellipse cannot be considered to be reliable.

Estimation of experimental errors is very difficult. We have used a simple model and have tried not to overestimate the errors so as to avoid discarding useful data.

In this article we have assumed that the errors in the measured  $ \Delta x $ ,  $ \Delta y $  and  $ \Delta Y $  values are randomly distributed within a normal distribution of mean zero and standard deviation corresponding to 5% of the individual differences. The magnitude of the error is based on repeat measurements made during the experimental work described earlier; the errors found were somewhat lower than 5%, but a realistic error must include possible changes in the samples during the period of the experiment. In some of the previously published work the time span of the experiment was much longer, and in some cases the differences were considerably smaller. On balance we consider that the figure of 5% is realistic in most cases, but possibly rather low in the rest.

For the visual results in the present work, the standard deviation of the individual  $ \Delta V $  values, after conversion from the GS values, was 40%. This value is consistent with earlier estimates of errors in visual assessments. $ ^{[17]} $  For the mean of 20 assessments, the standard deviation is therefore  $ 40/20^{1/2} $  or 9% of the  $ \Delta V $  value. A value of 10% was used in the simulation for all visual results in the form of  $ \Delta V $  values. For visual results from the two-category experiments, e.g., percent-acceptability data, the results were expressed as a fraction and a standard deviation of 0.05 was used. This was based on the expected errors for a binomial distribution. For a colour difference assessed n times, if the expected fraction of acceptances is q, the standard deviation of the number of acceptances should be  $ (nq(1-q))^{1/2} $ . Thus for 40 assessments, if q = 0.1, the number of acceptances should be 4 with a standard deviation of 1.9. Hence the fraction of acceptances A is  $ 0.10 \pm 0.0475 $ . Higher values of n give somewhat smaller standard deviations, but values of q closer to 0.5 lead to higher standard deviations. For simplicity a value of 0.05 was used in every case.

For any one colour centre, ellipses were calculated using the experimental data and ten sets of simulated data. Each ellipse from a set of simulated data was compared to the ellipse for the experimental data using a method similar to that used by Strocka et al. $ ^{5} $ . Rather than use some average deviation between the two ellipses, we have calculated the maximum discrepancy in the ratio of  $ \Delta E $  values calculated from the two ellipses equations using 500 randomly generated colour differences. If the ratio of the  $ \Delta E $  values fell outside the range 0.7 to 1.4 for no more than one of the simulated ellipses, the ellipse was considered to be reliable. If the ratio fell outside the required range for three or more of the simulated ellipses, the ellipse was considered to be unreliable. Borderline cases were judged partly by the magnitude of the ratio but mainly by comparing them with ellipses for similar colours; ellipses not fitting the overall pattern were rejected. In this way a total of 136 "reliable" ellipses was obtained.

The percentage of reliable ellipses obtained by Alder $ ^{18} $  using some of the same data was considerably lower (<50%). This is partly due to differences in the ellipsoid-fitting methods (Alder's method ignored samples where A was zero or one), but also partly due to the use of lower simulated errors in the present work. The objective was to obtain as many ellipses as possible, and hence a less restrictive definition of reliability has been used. This may have resulted in some ellipses being mistakenly classed as reliable.

Inspection of plots of the ellipses showed that four did not fit the general pattern of a/b and  $ \theta $  values, and these were rejected from further consideration.

Although the present article is concerned with chromaticity discrimination, eq. (3) represents colours in three dimensions. Furthermore, in some of the experimental studies, lightness differences have been minimised and hence possibly eq. (3) should not be used. Hence ellipse calculations were carried out as described earlier, but also (a) setting  $ g_{13} $  and  $ g_{23} $  equal to zero and (b) setting  $ g_{13} $ ,  $ g_{23} $ , and  $ g_{33} $  equal to zero. In general it was found that for the "reliable" ellipses the three methods gave very similar ellipses, the a and b values usually agreeing to within 10% and the  $ \theta $  values almost always agreeing to within 5°.

It should be stressed that the main factor in determining the reliability of an ellipse appears to be the distribution of the samples around the standard for a particular set. If the samples are well distributed, covering all the possible directions, a reliable ellipse is obtained. For sets where the number of samples is small it is unlikely that the different directions will have been adequately covered unless the samples were carefully selected. Thus it is perfectly possible for sets rejected to consist of accurate experimental data which is more than adequate for other purposes. The difficulties involved in getting a satisfactory distribution of samples can be illustrated by the fact that of the 188 centres considered, only 132 gave reliable ellipses and only 45 gave reliable ellipsoids.

Although, as indicated earlier, test calculations showed that our computer programs gave ellipses in very good agreement with those from other programs, in some cases considerable disagreement has been found. For the VVVR data, for the Y colour centre our a value is twice as high as that obtained by Friele, $ ^{23} $  while for the GY set the  $ \theta $  values differ by  $ 40^{\circ} $ . Similarly, for the DF data there are large differences between our ellipses and those calculated by Kuehni. $ ^{24} $ 

We suspect that these discrepancies occur for colour centres for which the sample distribution is not really satisfactory, despite the ellipses being classed as reliable by our methods. For some of these centres we have obtained significantly different ellipses depending on whether  $ g_{13} $ ,  $ g_{23} $ , and  $ g_{33} $  were set equal to zero. For example, for the VVVR DP set, the a/b ratio changed from 2.04 to 1.24 when  $ g_{13} $  and  $ g_{23} $  were set equal to zero.

It is obvious that to obtain reliable values for all six g values, the sample distribution must be satisfactory in all three dimensions. It also appears that if the sample distribution in the xY and yY planes is unsatisfactory, including  $ g_{13} $ ,  $ g_{23} $ , and  $ g_{33} $  in the calculations can cause large errors in  $ g_{11} $ ,  $ g_{12} $ , and  $ g_{22} $ .

## Plot of Ellipses in Chromaticity Diagram

Of the 132 centres for which reliable ellipses were obtained, the original experimental data were for illuminant C (1931 standard observer) in 34 cases, illuminant  $ M^{1} $  in 17 cases, illuminant  $ D_{65} $  (1964 standard observer) for the remainder. Measurements on samples corresponding to some of these centres showed that measurements for these conditions could differ by up to 10 CIELAB units. It was therefore decided to transform the coordinates for the centres to a common base  $ (D_{65}, 1964 $  standard observer) using the von Kries transformation. $ ^{25} $  Calculations were also carried out using Bartleson's transformation equations. $ ^{26} $  The results were very similar, the transformed chromaticity coordinates never differing by more than 0.003.

The ellipses, after transformation of the coordinates for the centres, are shown plotted in a chromaticity diagram in Fig. 2. As expected, the ellipses do not agree at all well with each other. Closer inspection shows that the main discrepancies lie in the relative sizes of the ellipses; the orientations of the ellipses and to a lesser extent the $a/b$ ratios form regular patterns. The patterns are discussed in more detail later, but it can be seen that the ellipses for the red, yellow, green–yellow, and blue centres tend to point along lines of constant dominant wavelength. The $a/b$ values tend to be high for the blue centres, the average ratio being 4.4 for the ten centres where $x < 0.25$ and $y < 0.24$, and low for those in the blue–green region, for which the average ratio for the eighteen centres with $x < 0.31$ and $0.325 < y < 0.41$ is 1.5. In the latter region, the $\theta$ values are much less regular, partly because some of the ellipses are almost circles.

There are several possible reasons for the discrepancies in the relative sizes of the ellipses.

(a) The visual results from the different studies are based on different scales. For example, in the Bradford work, the  $ \Delta V $  values were obtained from ratio experiments in which one difference was assessed as a ratio of other differences. All the results were supposedly put on a common scale by comparing samples from one colour centre with those from other colour centres. Similarly, all the MMB data were obtained using the same category method, while in the DF study the same panel of observers carried out acceptability assessments. There is no reason to suppose that ellipses corresponding to an arbitrary  $ \Delta V $  value from the Bradford work should correspond to those from the MMB work or to those corresponding to 50% acceptability from the DF work. Even in different acceptability studies there is no

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl//9cb49690-069d-4e4e-bc7e-b1a742769de7/markdown_5/imgs/img_in_image_box_259_725_995_1464.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2025-12-30T04%3A23%3A07Z%2F-1%2F%2Fb119fc938da04a83b6a3009624e6dfaaf7bfe053f84bf3a4a4ef409a77a9a53d" alt="Image" width="60%" /></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">FIG. 2. Chromaticity-discrimination ellipses plotted in the CIE1964 x, y diagram. Ellipses unadjusted but plotted 1.5 times actual size.</div>


reason to suppose that the different panels of observers worked to the same tolerance limit.

(b) Chromaticity discrimination varies with Y level $ ^{6} $ ; for very dark colours the ellipses are larger.

(c) Even considering the results within one study and ignoring differences in Y level, there may well be problems. In some studies more than one substrate has been used; the same measured difference may be more noticeable on one substrate than on another. In some cases, e.g., ISCC scale 1, experiments for different colour centres were carried out independently and no attempt was made to place the visual results on a common scale. Davidson and Friede $ ^{11} $  suggested that in acceptability experiments the observers may be influenced by the size of the differences being assessed. In effect the tolerance limit used for one colour centre may be different from that for other centres, thus affecting the size of the tolerance ellipse. In the MMB $ ^{1} $  study, the observers had to place differences in categories such as “noticeable difference” and “fairly large difference.” If the observer’s judgement as to what constituted a “fairly large difference” changed from one set of samples to another, this would change the visual scale and hence the size of ellipse. For convenience, it is usual in such studies to carry out assessments for the samples for one colour centre at the same time; other colour centres may be studied after a considerable passage of time.

## New Experiments

It is difficult to judge which of the factors outlined above are the most important. However, Fig. 2 clearly shows that major adjustments are needed. It was therefore decided to prepare samples corresponding to a number of the colour centres, and to assess these on a common scale. The choice of colour centres was somewhat arbitrary but guided by the following points:

(a) At least one colour centre from each data set was included. Assuming that the data within a data set are on a common scale, this would allow all the data sets to be brought onto the same scale.

(b) The centres chosen were to be reasonably distributed over the chromaticity diagram.

(c) Colour centres for which the ellipse looked particularly odd were chosen.

(d) For five centres, samples were also prepared at different Y levels, allowing the variation of chromaticity discrimination with Y level to be checked.

At least three pairs of samples were prepared for each of the 70 colour centres chosen. In some cases the new results appeared to be inconsistent with the original data and extra pairs, up to ten pairs per centre, were prepared. The 413 sample pairs were measured and assessed as described earlier. Detailed results can be obtained from the authors.

## Adjustment of Ellipses

## I ndividual Set Factors ( $ \overline{R} $ )

For each new pair of samples the ratio $R = \Delta E/\Delta V$, where $\Delta E$ was calculated from the appropriate ellipse equation and $\Delta V$ was obtained from the grey-scale assessments via eq. (2), was calculated. The mean of the $R$ values for any one colour centre was also calculated and denoted by $\overline{R}$.

The individual R values for any one colour centre should have been constant. In most cases the variation was considered to be reasonable (less than  $ \pm20\% $ ), but in a few cases large variations were found, indicating inconsistencies between the new and the original data. For example, for the MMB GY colour centre, the  $ \Delta E/\Delta V $  values ranged from 0.85 to 2.65. In such cases, extra pairs of samples were prepared giving a total of up to ten pairs per colour centre. Then a new ellipse was calculated using the new and original data for a particular centre combined together. The ellipses from the combined data generally corresponded more closely to neighbouring ellipses with respect to a/b and  $ \theta $  than did the original ellipses. For example, for MMB GY the  $ \theta $  value increased from  $ 3^{\circ} $  to  $ 25^{\circ} $ , much closer to the value of  $ 35^{\circ} $  for BFD RCK20 and KMET C. New ellipses were calculated using the combined data whenever this was possible, and the new ellipses were used to recalculate the R and  $ \bar{R} $  values. In all but a few cases, the new and old ellipses agreed well. For example, in only six cases did the  $ \theta $  values differ by more than  $ 5^{\circ} $ .

It should be noted that in general the new results for any one centre would not be sufficient to define a reliable ellipse; as indicated earlier it is important that the different possible directions for colour differences are adequately covered. Combining new and original results should have improved the coverage of the possible directions and, in addition, the effects of any errors in the original data may well have been reduced. In some cases inspection of the original data suggests that some points are considerably in error. However, such judgements are highly subjective. We have tried to reject as little of the original data as possible. Our hope is that by using as many experimental results as possible, the effects caused by experimental errors in some cases will not alter the overall pattern.

## V ariation of Ellipse Size with Y

As indicated earlier, for five colour centres (BFD RCK18, KPC27, CIE GY, Y, and MCD 40) pairs were also prepared at chromaticity coordinates corresponding to the colour centre, but at different Y levels. For any one centre the  $ \overline{R} $  values were calculated for each Y level and normalised by dividing  $ \overline{R} $  for Y = 30 by  $ \overline{R} $  for any other level. Designating these values as ellipse size factors (ESF), any variation in ESF with Y level indicates a change in chromaticity discrimination with Y level, and ESF values from the different centres can be directly compared. The results are summarised in Fig. 3. Each point is the average of from 3 to 6 ESF values for data at approximately the same Y level. Each  $ \overline{R} $  value was obtained from data for 3 to 5 pairs. The line corresponds to the variation expected from previous work $ ^{6} $  i.e.,  $ \mathrm{ESF} = (Y/30)^{0.2} $ . There is a clear indication that ESF increases as Y increases when Y is low, but for high Y values there is no clear trend. The points were considered to be close enough.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl//9cb49690-069d-4e4e-bc7e-b1a742769de7/markdown_7/imgs/img_in_chart_box_137_124_578_534.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2025-12-30T04%3A23%3A08Z%2F-1%2F%2Fd2aad771d696a1874d8437268ee60e16036562c057206c611e95265d1b73dcdb" alt="Image" width="36%" /></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">FIG. 3. Variation of ellipse size factor (ESF) with Y.</div>


to the line to justify using the ratio  $ (30/Y)^{0.2} $  to adjust ellipse sizes to a common level. It should be noted that other functions might fit the data equally well. Except for low Y values, any adjustment is small; for Y = 8 to Y = 72 the ratio changes only from 0.76 to 1.19.

## I ndirect Adjustment Ratios

For 51 colour centres, although no new samples were specially prepared, it was possible to find pairs prepared corresponding to other centres which were reasonably close in chromaticity  $ (\pm0.025) $ , but often with a different Y value. For example, for the VVVR Y colour centre  $ (Y=62.8) $  10 pairs with sufficiently close x, y values but different Y values (30 to 50) were found. In these cases, the grey-scale visual results for these pairs were corrected to those which would have been obtained had the pairs had the Y value of the appropriate centre, i.e.,

 $$ \mathrm{c o r r e c t e d}\Delta V=\Delta V_{\mathrm{e x p t}}\mathrm{\boldmath~x~}\left(\frac{Y_{\mathrm{c e n t r e}}}{Y_{\mathrm{e x p t}}}\right)^{0.2}. $$ 

As indicated earlier, the degree of correction from this fifth-root function is small in most cases and hence reasonably reliable.

After correction, the results were treated as before, i.e.  $ \bar{R} $  values were calculated for each colour centre for which the method was applicable.

## Adjustment Factors for Groups of Experimental Data

Table III gives the set names and x, y, and Y values for each color centre for which a reliable ellipse was obtained, together with the  $ \overline{R} $  values obtained using the direct and indirect methods.

It can be seen that the values for any one set of data, such as VVVR, while far from constant, differ considerably from those for other sets, e.g., BFD or MCD. The means of the  $ \bar{R} $  values for each group are also given in Table III as set factors (SF). They range from 0.53 for the MCD data to 2.13 for the VVVR data.

These different SF values result from the different visual scales and conditions used in the various experiments and were used to adjust the ellipses onto a common scale.

For a set such as MCD where SF is low, this means that the  $ \Delta E/\Delta V $  values were low, i.e., the  $ \Delta E $  values, from the ellipse equations and corresponding to unit visual difference on the grey scale, were low. This in turn means that the original ellipses were large, i.e., based on a relatively slack tolerance limit. Thus the a and b values obtained directly from the experimental data were all adjusted by multiplying by the appropriate SF values.

The resultant ellipses are plotted in Fig. 4. While the pattern of ellipses is much better than that in Fig. 2, there are still considerable differences in size between neighbouring ellipses. For example, the ellipses around x = 0.45, y = 0.49 (MMB GY and KMET C) differ in size by a factor of about 3.

Some of the remaining discrepancy is because the different colour centres often correspond to different Y levels. Adjustment to a common Y value of 30 by multiplying the a and b values by  $ \left(\frac{Y_{centre}}{30}\right)^{0.2} $  gave the ellipses shown in Fig. 5. Overall, there is little improvement. However, if only those centres for which Y < 5 are considered, i.e., the ellipses where the axes are included, some ellipses which were obviously too large have been reduced to a more reasonable size.

## I ndividual Colour Centre Adjustments

In Fig. 5 neighbouring ellipses still differ in size by factors of more than two, e.g., those close to x = 0.27, y = 0.3. Similarly the  $ \bar{R} $  values in Table III within any one data group vary by factors of up to almost four. Possible reasons for this were given earlier, but the factors are surprisingly high. The variation of  $ \bar{R} $  within each data group is listed in Table IV, ignoring groups with less than 6 colour centres. The values are high in all cases and in general are highest for the groups with most centres. This would be expected on purely statistical grounds.

Each ellipse was readjusted using the  $ \bar{R} $  values for the individual centres rather than the group means. For the 11 centres for which an individual value was not available, the appropriate SF value was used. Again the sizes were adjusted to Y = 30. The results are shown in Fig. 6. The ellipses look much more consistent than do those in the previous plots. With very few exceptions, the sizes of the neighbouring ellipses are very similar. Furthermore the a/b and  $ \theta $  values form a regular pattern, again with only a few exceptions.

The ellipses are replotted in Fig. 7, with those from acceptability studies marked with the letter A. The near-neutral region is shown on an enlarged scale in Fig. 8. Although in a few cases a perceptibility ellipse looks substantially different from a nearby acceptability ellipse, there are also

 $ ^{a} $ The a values given have been adjusted using the  $ \overline{R} $  values, but not adjusted for Y level. The ellipses in Figs. 6, 7, and 8 were obtained by multiplying the a values in Table III by 1.5 (Y/30) $ ^{0.2} $ .

instances where two neighbouring acceptability or two neighbouring perceptibility ellipses are quite different. The acceptability and perceptibility ellipses seem to form part of the same overall pattern.

## Quantitative Treatment of Ellipse Parameters

Visual inspection of the ellipses is not very satisfactory and a more objective approach was required. It was decided to consider the  $ \theta $  values, the a/b values, and the sizes of the ellipses separately.

## Orientation (θ) of the Ellipses

The  $ \theta $  values are plotted on a chromaticity diagram in Fig. 9. Inspection allows the variation of  $ \theta $  with chromaticity to be seen more clearly. The chromaticity diagram has been divided, somewhat arbitrarily, into seven different regions (R1 to R7). Within the regions marked (except for R4), the values are roughly constant.

The means and standard deviations of the  $ \theta $  values for the centres within each region are given in Table V.

The most obvious trend is the increase in  $ \theta $  from R1 through R2 to R3, i.e., as the colour changes from red through orange and yellow to yellow–green. Some of the variation within any one region is obviously associated with this trend. For example, the  $ \theta $  value for RCK 18 is  $ 24^{\circ} $ , higher than usual for R1, but the centre lies close to the boundary between R1 and R2 and hence a value about half way between the means of the regions ( $ 9^{\circ} $  and  $ 43^{\circ} $ ) would be expected. Similarly, for RCK 4, the  $ \theta $  value is  $ 57^{\circ} $ , high for R2, but reasonable for a centre close to the boundary between R2 and R3. Considering this type of trend, the standard deviations in Table V are surprisingly low.

Even for region 4, where the  $ \theta $  values are irregular, the ellipses form part of a consistent pattern. For centres close to x = 0.25 and y = 0.37, the ellipses are almost circles and the  $ \theta $  values are therefore irregular, but unimportant. Ellipses closer to the neutral point tend to have  $ \theta $  values around  $ 45^{\circ} $ , while for the more saturated colours the ellipses tend to point along lines of constant dominant wavelength.

Table V also gives the means and standard deviations for the acceptability and perceptibility ellipses within each region, together with the corresponding numbers of centres, n.

The mean values from the acceptability ellipses agree well with the corresponding values for the ellipses based on perceptibility studies.

As indicated earlier, several different substrates were used in the work under discussion. The simplest division is between textile and nontextile substrates, and the results are also given separately for these in Table V. Again the differences are small, although it should be pointed out that all the acceptability studies used textile substrates while only 20 of the perceptibility ellipses discussed in Table V are based on textiles.

There is little evidence in Fig. 9 of the discontinuity in  $ \theta $  values at dominant wavelength about 570 nm reported by Kuehni $ ^{24} $ . The boundary between R1 and R2 corresponds to about 575 nm while that between R2 and R3 corresponds to about 560 nm. These boundaries were chosen partly with a view to enclosing centres with approximately the same  $ \theta $  values within one region, and partly by drawing the boundaries along natural gaps between the ellipses. Hence the boundaries should correspond to any obvious discontinuity or even sharp change in  $ \theta $ . Kuehni also reported a discontinuity at 494 nm. This corresponds roughly to the middle of our region 4, and as indicated earlier the  $ \theta $  values do indeed change considerably in this region. However, the fact that the ellipses in the region are roughly circular means that the angles are relatively unimportant. Any real discontinuity would be very difficult to cope with as far as colour-difference equations are concerned. The present results provide no evidence for any such discontinuity, but we can say that our ellipses are consistent with Kuehni's claim in that the angles do change rapidly.

## Shape (a/b) of Ellipses

A treatment similar to that used to analyze  $ \theta $  values was applied to the a/b ratios. The regions chosen are shown in

Fig. 10, where the $a/b$ values have all been multiplied by ten to make the numbers more legible. The most obvious trend is that the $a/b$ ratios increase rapidly from region 5 through region 6 to region 7, although the ratios in regions 1 and 3 are generally higher than those in regions 2 and 4.

The means, standard deviations, and number of samples for each region are given in Table VI.

Again the values for the perceptibility, acceptability, textile and non-textile ellipses are given separately. As for the  $ \theta $  values, the differences between the values for the different subgroups are small, especially in view of the small numbers of ellipses in some of the subgroups.

The fact that the  $ \theta $  and a/b values vary systematically with chromaticity indicates that the values are reasonably reliable, and hence that the somewhat arbitrary decisions taken earlier, e.g., as to the “reliability” of the ellipses, were reasonable.

There has long been controversy as to whether or not results from acceptability experiments are consistent with those from perceptibility data. The present results show that there is little difference between acceptability and perceptibility chromaticity-discrimination ellipses. The same conclusion applies to ellipses based on different substrates, and there seems to be no reason why the different subgroups should not be combined.

It should be noted, however, that these conclusions apply only to the a/b and  $ \theta $  values of the ellipses; the sizes were adjusted on the basis of grey-scale (perceptibility) results using a textile substrate. Thus if, for example, acceptability results give larger ellipses for yellows relative to perceptibility ellipses, this would not show up in Fig. 7. Furthermore, the present paper is solely concerned with chromaticity differences and therefore gives no indication of factors such as the relative weighting required for lightness and chromaticness differences.

## Size of Ellipses

Inspection of Fig. 6 shows that for any direction from the neutral point, the size tends to increase as this distance increases. To consider this in a more quantitative manner, we have calculated the square root of the area,  $ (\pi ab)^{1/2} $ , [using the a and b values from Fig. 6, i.e., the a and b

values from Table III multiplied by  $ (Y/30)^{0.2} $  to represent the size of each ellipse. The variation of size with CIELAB chroma is illustrated in Table VII.

The size increases sharply with increase in chroma, at least up to chroma values of about 60. A closer inspection of the results showed that the ellipses for the green–yellow region, BFD RCK1, MMB SCG, MMB RG, MMB FG, MMB OG, KMET A, and W W, were all larger than expected. For example, for MMB OG the size was  $ 152 \times 10^{-4} $ , whereas for a chroma of 46 the value expected from Table VII is  $ 102 \times 10^{-4} $ . Similarly, the four most saturated blue centres, BFD KPC24, BFD KPC25, MMB MCB, and VVVR B, were all considerably smaller than expected. The calculations were repeated excluding these centres and the results are also given in Table VII. Although the mean sizes for each chroma range did not change much, the standard deviations were reduced for all ranges where any centres were excluded. The values which were highest originally (regions 6 and 7) were reduced most. The standard deviations could be reduced even further by identifying other groups of centres where the size depends on factors other than CIELAB chroma, but the values in Table VII are considered to be sufficiently low to show that the sizes of the ellipses do indeed fit a regular pattern.

The pattern formed by the MacAdam ellipses $ ^{27} $  is quite different in that the smallest ellipses correspond to very saturated blue colours, whereas in the present work the smallest ellipses correspond to grey or blue–grey colours, with a marked increase in size for more saturated blues, at least for y < 0.2.

The fact that the smallest ellipses in the present work occur for centres close in chromaticity to that of the background used is unlikely to be significant since previous work $ ^{28} $  under conditions similar to those used in the present work showed that the effect of the background (crispening effect) was very small.

## I mplications of the Need for Adjustment of the Sizes of Individual Ellipses

The consistent pattern formed by the sizes of the ellipses implies to us that the sizes are reasonably correct and hence the adjustment factors  $ (\bar{R} $  values) obtained in the present work are reasonably accurate. This implies that the relative sizes of the ellipses originally obtained even from centres within one data set were in error by a factor of 2 or more. The possible reasons given earlier no doubt account for some of the discrepancy, but seem unlikely to account for all of

the discrepancy. For example, in the MMB study all the samples were of the same material and assessed by the same method. While the category method used is open to criticism, it is difficult to believe that the visual scale could vary by 300% from one set to another. Similarly, for the BFD data, although paint and textile substrates were used, the size of the paint ellipses had supposedly been adjusted relative to the size of the textile ellipses and all the results brought onto a common scale by comparing pairs from different colour centres. Furthermore, even within the RCK centres (all paint and all directly compared), the  $ \overline{R} $  values vary by a factor of two.

It seems that there is some unidentified factor which makes comparisons of visual differences for different colours particularly difficult, and this factor seems to apply to all the published work irrespective of the visual method employed. The grey-scale method used in the present work, however, appears to have given good results. This could be partly because the same panel of observers was used and the assessments were carried out over a short period of time. Furthermore, in the selection of centres to be studied, centres where the original ellipses looked worst tended to be chosen. Nonetheless, in any future work the relationship between results for different colour centres should be carefully studied. The grey-scale method should be used, possibly together with other methods. An independent check on the correctness of the present work would be very useful. The five CIE centres $ ^{8} $  might provide a useful starting point.
