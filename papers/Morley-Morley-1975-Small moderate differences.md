In nineteen regions of colour space groups of about 30 samples, differing by small to moderate amounts from one designated as 'the standard' were generated by offset printing. Twenty observers estimated the perceived size of each of these differences twice, using category scaling – the judgements were not based on acceptability. The samples were placed, in turn, adjacent to the standard on a middle gray surround, subtended 4° on the retina, were illuminated with semidiffuse fluorescent light, simulating daylight at about 45° incidence, and viewed along the normal. The visual data were converted from an ordinal to an interval scale. The samples were measured by abridged spectrophotometry, and CIE coordinates, obtained by integration using the spectral-power distribution of the illumination source and the 1931 2° standard observer. Colour differences were calculated by eleven formulae and correlated with the visual interval-scale results. The usual low correlation coefficients were found. The data are analysed colour by colour and significant differences are noted. Collectively, the Adams Chromatic Value (ANL AB 40), Saunderson-Milner, and CIE 1976 L*a*b* formulae gave better performances.

## I ntroduction

The calculation of numbers which correlate with visual experience and describe small and moderate colour differences is an industrially important but very difficult task. Much effort has been expended on the subject in recent years, and a book [2] has been published which summarizes the results of a week-long symposium on colour metrics and colour-difference formulae. As pointed out recently by the late Ralph M. Evans [3], much of the difficulty may arise because classical colorimetry, such as that described by the CIE system [4], is not sufficient to attack the problem; rather, some additional information on the perception of colour must be added. Historically, as described below, this information has taken the form of perceptibility data, at the just-perceptible difference threshold, using aperture-mode stimuli (coloured lights) or acceptability data (the usual case) of moderate colour differences, obtained with surface-colour stimuli (physical samples).

At the symposium mentioned above, emphasis was placed on the need for new bodies of visual data obtained in experiments based on perceptibility rather than acceptability. In response to this we report a series of experiments on the judgement of small to moderate colour differences, based on category scaling for perceptibility in surface-mode samples at a number of regions in colour space. In this paper we take the point of view that, while accurate colour measurement of adequate samples is now routine, the quantitative analysis of the visual data is not yet on as firm a basis and requires major attention.

## Historical Survey

This section places emphasis on the various means which have been used to scale observed colour differences visually. The experiments fall into two groups depending in part on the type of stimuli used (aperture or surface) and in part, on the type of information desired (perceptibility or acceptability). The great advantage of using aperture stimuli, as with a colorimeter, is that it allows the experimenter to vary the stimulus continuously and produce with ease any desired colour within the gamut of the colorimeter. Offsetting this advantage is the fact that once prepared, surface-colour samples are always at hand, for future reference and intercomparison, facilitating such scaling techniques as rank ordering. However, it is well recognized that, with real samples, it is far more difficult to produce exactly the desired colours, and that by their very nature the stimuli are not continuously variable.

Additionally, many industrial colourists feel that tangible samples and aperture colours are inherently different, with respect to colour-difference stimuli, even when factors such as gloss and texture are carefully controlled. It is also possible that the presumed difference is related to other perceptual variables, such as the relative luminances of the stimuli and their surround.

## APERTURE-MODE EXPERIMENTS

Virtually all studies of small colour differences, using coloured lights, have been directed towards determining the perceptibility threshold for chromaticity differences or colour differences. The classic work of MacAdam  $ [5] $ , describing visual sensitivities to chromaticity differences in daylight conditions, has set many of the viewing condition standards for this technique. His observer viewed a  $ 2^{\circ} $  bipartite field monocularly through an artificial pupil, the  $ 40^{\circ} $  surround had half the luminance of the field. The observer's task was to adjust one field to achieve a match, which the experimenter then disturbed and the observer rematched. The task was repeated several times, for each of several directions of chromaticity mismatch, and the results were presented as ellipses representing the standard deviations of the settings.

Brown and MacAdam  $ [6] $  extended the work to include

luminance as well as chromaticity differences, using a binocular wide-field colorimeter not requiring an artificial pupil. More recently, Wyszecki and Fielder [7] performed similar experiments using a 6° field, again surrounded by a 40° field of half the luminance of the test area. They found that an observer's ellipses can change shape and size from day to day. Despite this unexpected element of uncertainty, the CIE Colorimetry Committee TC-1.3 has indicated its feeling that representative threshold perceptibility data are now at hand.

A further significant contribution was made by Pointer [8], who showed that the threshold does not change with the state of adaptation of the observer over a considerable range, including daylight and tungsten illumination.

## SURFACE-MODE EXPERIMENTS

Most of the interest in colour differences in relation to surface colours has come from industry, where acceptable commercial tolerances are an ever-present problem. Studies of the acceptability of small but supra-threshold colour differences have been made using a variety of methods of scaling.

In most studies with surface colours the observers have been required to determine whether or not the colour-difference pair represents an acceptable commercial match. The percentage acceptability in many trials is then compared with calculated colour differences. When, as is usual, a wide gamut of colours is included, the correlations are invariably poor. One of the chief recent contributors in this field has been Jaekel  $ [9] $ , and similar studies have been undertaken by Davidson and Friede  $ [10] $ , Thurner and Walter  $ [11] $ , Robinson  $ [12] $ , Strocka  $ [13] $ , and Kuehni  $ [14] $ . Although listed here as an acceptability study, Robinson in fact rated his samples by category scaling, using a six-point scale, but then analysed the data by classing the first three categories as acceptable and the last three as unacceptable.

The School of Colour Chemistry at Bradford University has also made major contributions, including studying several types of scaling methods, using textile and paint samples. Coates et al  $ [15] $  found high correlation among the results of ratio, rank-order and paired-comparison scaling. Using rank-order scaling, Coates et al  $ [16] $  found that computed colour differences correlated well with visual assessments only for certain illuminating and viewing conditions which were very different from those found in industrial practice. In another study, Coates et al  $ [17] $  transformed the Davidson and Friede acceptability data into a visual colour-difference scale using a transform function much like the statistical normal distribution.

Sugiyama and Wright  $ [18] $  investigated the method of paired comparisons, and later  $ [19] $  compared it to ratio scaling. In this test, triads of constant-luminance samples were viewed on a black surround with the observer being first asked to rank the sizes of the colour differences, and then estimate the ratio of the larger differences to the smaller.

Several investigators have examined multidimensional scaling techniques. Using the same type of experiment as Sugiyama and Wright, the latter author  $ [20] $  found that the precision of colour-difference estimation was  $ \pm30\% $ , and the variation amongst the samples could be accounted for in a two-dimensional space. Helm  $ [21] $  described a multidimensional ratio scaling experiment which yielded a logarithmic relationship with the results obtained using the method of successive intervals. Indow and coworkers  $ [22] $  used multidimensional mapping techniques to examine the spacing and dimensionality of the Munsell colour space.

Finally, a recommended practice for the visual observation of small colour differences was prepared by a Problems Subcommittee of the Inter-Society Color Council under the chairmanship of Huey $ ^{[23]} $ .

## Philosophy of the Morley Experiment

Even in the mid-1960's, when this experiment was begun it was apparent that new data were needed to provide answers to questions of commercial importance, about the judgement and calculation of small to moderate colour differences. Specifically, it was important to one of the authors (D.I.M.) to establish which of the many proposed colour-difference formulae was the best for the range of colours found in printing inks used for packaging. At that time very few ranges of the more saturated surface colours had been examined, aside from the samples of the Munsell Book of Color. Accordingly, saturated colours were emphasized in the early stages of the experiment, though eventually many desaturated ranges were included.

At that time, and only to a somewhat lesser extent now, very little attention had been given to the methods of psychophysical testing and of scaling the magnitudes of colour differences as estimated by observers. Two facts associated with the industrial utilization of the results of the experiment bore on this point: firstly, it was important that differences were examined which were considerably larger than the just-noticeable difference; and secondly, it was not advisable to scale the visual judgements on the basis of acceptability, as in the printing industry the scale of acceptability varies from job to job.

At Metal Box Ltd., where the visual observations were carried out, there had been developed considerable experience with small-panel trials, in which four observers ranked repeat batches of printing inks using a 3-point scale: no difference, just-noticeable difference, and different. Although it was necessary to extend this scale, in order to accommodate larger differences, the Morley experiment embodies the philosophy of this experience in the category scaling of the perceptibility of colour differences in ranges of saturated surface colours.

## Experimental

## SAMPLES

The samples for the Morley experiment were prepared, over a period of years, by academic students in the printing industry as part of their summer industrial training. Each student prepared one range of colour, which is identified in this paper by the initial of his name.

## Materials

The samples were made by printing standard tin-printing inks on white coated tinplate. The variability in colour within a range was achieved by modifying the colorant concentrations in the ink mix before printing. Because these inks have very low scattering power they were printed on conventional white coated tinplate taken from production.

## Printing

Printing was done on a proof print tester developed at Metal Box consisting of a 3-roll system with one driven and one

idling steel roller, with an oscillating rubber roller on top. A controlled volume of ink was uniformly distributed over the system and then transferred to a 2.5 cm wide applicator-roller covered with conventional lithographic blanket material. From this printing blanket the ink was laid down on the coated tinplate under controlled conditions of pressure and speed. This method gave close control over the print structure and ink film thickness, over the entire length of the printing – about 20 cm. Film thickness was about that usually achieved in lithographic printing, 1.5  $ \mu $ m, but in some samples it ranged up to 3  $ \mu $ m.

After printing, the samples were stoved to harden the ink and then varnished to minimize degradation due to handling. Unlike printings on paper or board, the tinplate samples stand up well to the handling received in large panel trials. They remain in good condition after use in many other colour-difference trials (for example, [1]).

## Selection

From a large number of samples prepared in this way, 30 with good print structure were chosen for each colour range to form a 'cloud' reasonably distributed in colour space. One sample in the centre of the distribution was selected as the standard on the basis of a preliminary visual evaluation, and the remainder were chosen to place roughly equal numbers in each of the scaling categories described below. The samples were then cut to approximately  $ 2.5 \times 5 $  cm and mounted on  $ 10 \times 15 $  cm cardboard for further protection and ease of handling. One of the 30 samples was generally a part of the standard print, which should ideally give a 'no difference' judgement.

## V ISUAL ASSESSMENT

## I llumination

Visual observations in the Morley experiment were carried out using Thorn Electrical Industries 'Artificial Daylight' fluorescent lamps. These lamps are supplied to close tolerances, in spectral power distribution, and are intended to simulate CIE  $ D_{65} $ . The (normalized) CIE tristimulus values and chromaticity coordinates of these lamps (hereafter called Source M) are X = 94.65, Y = 100.00, Z = 103.97, x = 0.3170, y = 0.3349, and its correlated colour temperature is 6500 K. With respect to Illuminant  $ D_{65} $ , Source M has a CIE General Colour Rendering Index of 94 and Special Colour Rendering Indices R1 to R8 of 97, 95, 87, 95, 97, 92, 92, and 93, respectively. The spectral-power distribution of Source M is given in Table 1.

During the 6 years over which the visual judgements were made three different rooms were used for the observations; all were painted a neutral grey with a paint conforming to BS 2660, No. 9-094 and having a luminance of about 50. The level of illumination was 1000 lux. Although the sizes and shapes of the rooms differed, the analysis of variance of the results to be described did not indicate any systematic errors from this source.

## I lluminating and Viewing Geometry

A small lectern was built to hold the samples at an angle of 45° to the horizontal. With the lamp fixtures overhead, the illumination was over a range of angles centering on 45°, and the samples were viewed along the normal to their surface. The lectern surface, 15 x 18 cm, was painted neutral grey with

luminance 27. Sample and standard were displayed side by side with only a hairline separation through an aperture. The pair subtended about 2–4 degrees on the retina.

## Observations

Twenty observers viewed each combination of sample and standard (30 in all for each colour range) on two occasions. The observers, all of whom had normal colour vision as indicated by the Ishihara test, came from many different professions, mostly within Metal Box, including professional printers, professional and academic scientists, and administrative personnel. The group of observers was not the same for each colour range. The analysis of variance to be described showed that the different groups of observers made very little difference in the scaling of the colour differences.

## Scaling

The magnitudes of the colour differences were assessed by 6-point category scaling. The following description of the six categories was in front of the observers at all times

1. No difference

II. Just noticeable difference

III. Noticeable difference

IV. Fairly large difference

V. Large difference

VI. Very large difference

As a practical point in earlier small panel trials, the category of just noticeable difference was attributed to matches in which there was no perceptible difference when the standard was on one side of the sample, but a difference was seen when they were reversed; many of the observers were familiar with this practice. If an observer new to the methods of the experiment experienced extreme difficulty in interpre-

ting the category descriptions, he was told that a very large difference was, in terms of packaging, one which under all conditions he could not help but notice, and in which the colour of the sample would be very different from his memory of the colour of the standard. In most cases, however, the observers were able to scale up from their sense of the just noticeable difference and did not require further interpretation of the categories. It was also noticed that once an observer had taken part in the experiment, he was always confident about the category limits in the future, even though several years might elapse before he again participated in the experiment.

## I NSTRUMENTAL MEASUREMENTS

Each of the samples was measured on a Kollmorgen KCS-40 abridged spectrophotometer  $ [24] $ , utilising diffuse/normal illuminating/viewing geometry with an integrating sphere. The large viewing area (1.9 cm diameter) was used, and the specular component was excluded in the measurements. The white reference standard was pressed  $ BaSO_{4} $ . Source A illumination was used, in the integrating sphere, for maximum signal-to-noise ratio in the instrument; since the samples are not fluorescent, there was no need to illuminate them with daylight-quality light for these spectral measurements. Spectral reflectance factors were obtained at 38 wavelengths, spaced every 10 nm, between 380 and 750 nm, and were automatically punched on paper tape for the off-line computations described below. Each sample was measured only once in view of the reliability and reproducibility demonstrated for this instrument in other studies  $ [25, 26] $ .

The 19 colour ranges used in this work are identified by range designation, ISCC-NBS colour name, and CIE chromaticity coordinates and luminances of the standard in Table 2. The chromaticities of the standards are identified on the 1931 CIE Chromaticity diagram in Figure 1.

## CALCULATION OF TRISTIMULUS VALUES

With the aid of an IBM 360–50 computer, CIE tristimulus values were calculated for each sample using the 1931 CIE 2° standard observer and each of three illuminants:  $ D_{65} $ , A, and M (the spectral-power distribution of the fluorescent tubes used in the visual observations). In the latter calculations, the reflectances required at the wavelengths of the mercury lines were calculated by 4-point Lagrangian interpolation using, for data at 10 nm intervals, the following equations derived as outlined by Foster et al [27]:

 $$ R_{404.7}=-0.0635R_{390}+0.5960R_{400}+0.5285R_{410} $$ 

 $$ \begin{aligned}R_{435.8}=&-0.0577R_{420}+0.4711R_{430}+0.6505R_{440}\\&-0.0639R_{450}\end{aligned} $$ 

 $$ \begin{array}{r l}{R_{546\cdot1}}&{=\;-0.0551R_{530}\;+\;0.4364R_{540}\;+\;0.6825R_{550}}\\ &{\;-\;0.0638R_{560}}\end{array} $$ 

 $$ R_{577\cdot8}=-0.0348R_{560}+0.2389R_{570}+0.8468R_{580}\\\quad-0.0509R_{590} $$ 

## I NDICES OF COLOUR CHANGE WITH ILLUMINANT

While it was desirable to have an index of the degree to which the relations amongst the colours in any range changed when the illuminant was altered, the use of the 1971 CIE Special Metamerism Index was not deemed appropriate since our sample pairs are not true metamers – i.e. they do not match under any illuminant known to us. As an alternative, we

calculated the components  $ \Lambda^{L} $ ,  $ \Delta^{a} $  and  $ \Delta^{b} $ , of the CIE 1976  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $  colour difference for each of CIE illuminants,  $ D_{65} $  and A, and for source M. These components were then subtracted algebraically in pairs to obtain difference components, indicative of the change in  $ \Delta^{L} $ ,  $ \Delta^{a} $  and  $ \Delta^{b} $  with change in illuminant. These difference components were combined by taking the square root of the sum of their squares, the resulting number being indicative of change in colour difference with change in illuminant. This was done for the comparison between Ill  $ D_{65} $  and Ill A, and for that between Ill  $ D_{65} $  and Source M. The results, given as averages for each colour range, are listed in Table 3. The standard deviations were in the range 0.001–0.003. The results indicate a moderate colour change, which we believe corresponds to a moderate degree of metamerism, averaging 1.5 CIE 1976  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $  units, for a change of illuminant from CIE  $ D_{65} $  to A. The average colour change for a change of illuminant from  $ D_{65} $  to Source M is small (0.32 units).

## CALCULATION OF COLOUR DIFFERENCES

Colour differences between the standard and each of the 30 samples were calculated for each colour range, using in turn each of the colour-difference formulae, listed here and given in full in Appendix A:

Adams chromatic value or Adams–Nickerson [29], in the ANLAB 40 version [30].

CIE 1964 [4, 31]

†CIE 1976 L*a*b* [32]

†CIE 1976 L*u*v* [32]

Friele-MacAdam-Chickering FMC-1 [34]

Friele-MacAdam Chickering FMC-2 [35, 36]

Reilly cube root [36, 37]

Hunter L, aL, bL [38]

Scofield [39]

Judd-Hunter NBS formula [40]

Saunderson-Milner [41].

†These two equations were recommended for study by CIE Committee 1.3, Colorimetry [32]. The CIE 1976 L*a*b* equation is of the cube-root type, and was selected to yield results in close agreement (except for a scaling factor near but not equal to unity) with ANLAB 40, whilst preserving the greater ease of computation associated with the cube-root function. The CIE 1976 L*u*v* formula is derived from the CIE 1964 U*V*W* equation by replacing the lightness function W* by the equivalent (for colour-difference calculation) L* and incorporating the modification $v'=1.5$ v suggested by Eastwood [33].

## Results and Discussion

## TABULATION OF DATA

For the benefit of those wishing to analyse the data further, a compilation of original data has been prepared (Appendix B). This appendix has not been included but can be obtained on request from the authors. It contains tristimulus values for the fluorescent-lamp illuminant (Source M) and visual scores in categories 1–6 for each of the 555 colours in 19 colour ranges.

## SCALING THE VISUAL RESULTS

Before considering how to transform the visual results for correlation with instrumentally measured colour difference, it was necessary to consider the nature of various number scales. The four generally recognised types of scale  $ [42] $  and the statistical treatments valid for them are described in Table 4. They range from the nominal scale, in which a number is used only as a label for a class, to the fully defined ratio scale.

The visual results of our experiments form ordinal scales, from which mean values and standard deviations cannot be calculated. It would be of obvious advantage to transform them to an interval scale and two transform functions were utilised: the first was the standard method described by Torgerson [43], and the second a logarithmic relationship [44] between the results in the category scale and those transformed into an equal-step nominal scale. The latter technique showed promise but was not fully pursued due to the limitations of time and staff.

Torgerson's method assumes that the distribution of visual scores for each colour should be statistically normal. As the data are obtained on an ordinal scale, they are not normally distributed, but it is assumed that if they were transformed to an interval scale they would become so. The objective of the transformation is therefore to force the data to fit the statistical normal distribution. This can be accomplished by dealing with the cumulated distributions.

Figure 2 indicates the application of Torgerson's method. At the lower left is a bar graph of a typical distribution of the 40 visual scores for a single colour: 1 in category I, 5 in II, 11 in III, 13 in IV, 7 in V, and 3 in VI. Above this is a bar graph representing the cumulative distribution for this data set. Both are on the ordinal scale. The cumulative curve of the statistical normal distribution is plotted at the top right; immediately below it is a line representing the interval scale. Arrows indicate the way in which the boundaries between categories I and II, II and III, .... V and VI are transferred to the interval scale line.

<div style="text-align: center;">Figure 2 – Transformation of visual colour-difference data from a typical distribution on an ordinal scale (lower left), through the cumulative distribution of those values (upper left), via the statistical normal distribution (upper right), to scale values on an interval scale (lower right).</div>


An interval scale has no fixed zero point, but one can be introduced arbitrarily if desired. In the figure, we have indicated, at the bottom right, the arbitrary choice of placing the zero of the interval scale at the boundary between categories I and II. The mean of the distribution (50th percentile of the cumulated normal distribution) and each of the category boundaries are referred to this point. The interval scale is the psychological scale, and the mean value of the normal distribution is the scale value.

If the transformation is made separately for each colour range, the best fits to the data are obtained, as indicated, for example, by the values of  $ \chi^{2} $  – described as Method 1 in Table 5. This method has the disadvantage, for our purposes, that the interval scale is different for each colour range – i.e., it has different fixed points – so that it is not possible to assemble all the results on a single scale and compare them with instrumental results. To obtain the same fixed points it would be necessary to compute the transformation for all 555 colours together, but this was not possible with the facilities at hand.

Instead, we forced the category boundaries for each colour range to lie at the same values on the interval scale, i.e. we made the mean category the same for all the examples. The validity of this is analysed in Table 6. An analysis of variance of these data shows the difference between category widths to be highly significant (F ratio of 123 on three degrees of freedom). But for the difference in category widths between colours, the F ratio on 17 degrees of freedom is only 1.46, which indicates a chance of less than 0.1% of the widths being different for different colours. The residual is very small. These results imply that, although the visual experiments were carried out by different groups of observers, in three different rooms and at widely different times, there was no major effect arising from these or any other variable. It is therefore valid to consider all the results on the same interval scale using the same category widths.

The mean values of the category widths, 1.5, 1.1, 0.8 and 0.8 for categories II–V respectively, were then used to set the interval scale values of the boundaries between categories. Since the interval scale has no zero it was necessary to

 $ ^{*} $ Category widths were not determined for colour range DG, since this part of the work was completed before these samples were made. Mean values of the category widths, used in the subsequent analysis, would have been affected only trivially by including the category widths for DG in the mean.

introduce an arbitrary zero, and we selected the boundary between categories I and II for this purpose.

It is a moot philosophical point as to whether this boundary between 'No difference' and 'Just Perceptible difference' is the correct place for the scale zero. In some ways it would appear more logical to place zero at the midpoint of category I, but since this category extends to $-\infty$, its midpoint is undefined. Since the location of the zero point is arbitrary, we shall pay little attention to the failure of regression lines to pass through the origin, recognising rather that the origin should be moved.

The category boundaries are then:

I. $-\infty$. to 0
II. 0 to 1.5
III. 1.5 to 2.6
IV. 2.6 to 3.4
V. 3.4 to 4.2
VI. 4.2 to $\infty$

The results given as Method 2 in Table 5 indicate that the degree of fit, as indicated by a  $ \chi^{2} $  analysis, is not as good as by Method 1, but it is now possible to compare the visual and instrumental results since all the visual data are now expressed on the same interval or psychological scale. The data given in Appendix B for all 555 samples include the number of observations in each category and the psychological scale value for each sample pair.

In applying the above method we incorporated the

correction due to Guilford  $ [45] $  which, in the transformation to the interval scale, reduces the overwhelming effect of the tails of the cumulative normal distribution curve. We have discarded the deviates below 5% and above 95% in the 40 observations of each sample pair. This resulted in the inability to set scale values for a few sample pairs, as may be seen on examination of the data in Appendix B.

FITTING VISUAL SCALES TO COLOUR-DIFFERENCE FORMULAE

## Coefficients for Individual Colour Ranges

Linear correlation coefficients R were calculated from the data of Appendix B for each colour range and each colour-difference formula. The results are given in Table 7, where the formulae are ordered as described in the following section. In the calculations it was assumed that the instrumental results were more precise than the visual, which certainly seems reasonable in terms of the good repeatability of the instrumental measurements  $ [25, 26] $ , and the measured values were regressed onto the observed values. Tests of significance show that all of the regression lines are significant at the 10% level, and most at the 0.1% level.

Examination of these correlation coefficients shows a substantial number above 0.80 and even above 0.90, which is considered encouraging indeed. However, no one formula shows such high regression coefficients for all colours, and it is perhaps most useful to judge formulae by examining the regions of colour space in which they fail to give good correlation to visual results rather than the reverse.

To facilitate this examination, the number of correlation coefficients falling in each of several numerical ranges has been tabulated for each formula, the results being given in Table 8. In so doing, we have omitted the results for colour McB, for which the correlations were invariably poor. In this table, the formulae have been ordered as described in the following section.

It now seems possible to draw a clear distinction between formulae, such as the CIE 1976  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $ , ANLAB 40, and Saunderson–Milner, which never had R below 0.700 amongst the 18 colours studied, and those, such as the CIE 1964, NBS, FMC–1, and FMC–2, for which R is below 0.700 for a third or more of the colours, with catastrophically low values, below 0.500, in several instances. The remaining formulae (CIE 1976  $ L^{*}u^{*}v^{*} $ , Hunter, Scofield, and Reilly cube root) are intermediate in performance using this criterion. On the other hand, the Reilly formula yielded values of R above 0.900 more often than any other formula; it is perhaps a matter of personal opinion as to the merit of this formula, which displays a wide range of values of R when compared to the first three mentioned, whose performance is more consistent.

Examination of Table 7 shows that the catastrophic failures, i.e. with R lower than 0.600, are about evenly divided between the greenish-blue and the purplish-red to red (pink) to reddish-orange hue regions. It is easy to ascertain the region or regions in which any formula is likely to perform worst (or best); but we do feel strongly that false conclusions

†Our only justification for this omission is that the McB samples were amongst the first to be made, and handling over the several years' span had reduced them to rather poor condition when the instrumental measurements were finally made. The correlation coefficients for McB were never significant at better than the 1% level.

can result if too few colours are used in such assessments. It is considered that the nineteen colours tested are too few, and that many more would be required before valid conclusions could be deduced.

## Correlation Coefficients for Combined Data

The values of R listed in Table 7 are not easily combined to demonstrate the best over-all fit. One simple way of doing this is merely to average the nineteen values of R for each formula. The resulting data are given in Table 9. Another way of ranking the formulae is by the correlation coefficient calculated by fitting a single line to all 555 data points for all colour ranges. Although the differences amongst formulae are small and often not statistically significant, the two sets of data in Table 9 and the ranking of values of R in Table 8 are all consistent with the order in which the formulae are listed in Tables 7–10. Treating the sets of 19 values of R by the method of Kramer [46] leads to slightly different ranking, but tests of significance at the 5% level show that the CIE 1976  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $ , CIE 1976  $ L^{*}u^{*}v^{*} $ , ANLAB 40, Saunderson–Milner, Scofield, Hunter, and Reilly equations are indistinguishably the best, and the FMC–2, FMC–1, NBS, and CIE 1964

formulae are indistinguishably the worst.

The consistency of behaviour, or lack thereof, for the various formulae is also shown by plots of the 19 regression lines for each formula. Because the differences are qualitative and for lack of space, we show (in Figure 3) only the plot for the CIE 1976 $L^{*}a^{*}b^{*}$ formula. That for ANLAB 40 is essentially identical, whilst all the others show greater spread in slopes (and intercepts) of the lines.

## 'Spread' of the Data

In addition to the correlation coefficients, we have also examined the distance on the visual scale between the lines representing the plus and minus 95% confidence limits of the linear regression data. This distance, which we call D, is a measure of the 'spread' amongst the data points around the

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl//47978a76-e9b5-4386-8975-baadcf1e01aa/markdown_8/imgs/img_in_chart_box_588_212_1110_593.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-01-03T08%3A27%3A46Z%2F-1%2F%2F2f318a8bb45a4011e738f99678cdb170f1305303ff26f33526b4cc8b1da7f47a" alt="Image" width="44%" /></div>

regression line. It has the dimensions of a standard deviation, and can therefore be used in more sophisticated statistical calculations than can the correlation coefficients themselves. Average values of D for the nineteen individual colours and values of D for the overall regression line are given in Table 10 for each formula.

The implication of the spread is given greater meaning by noting that a spread of ±2 on the visual colour-difference scale is equivalent to the range of categories II, III, IV, and V – that is, from the category boundaries of just-noticeable difference to large difference.

Although we have not tabulated them, the individual values of D (averaged in Table 10) vary with both the colour and the colour-difference formula. An analysis of variance showed that both colour and formula are significant at the 0.1% level, in causing the spread, with the residuals satisfyingly small. The effect of formula was anticipated, and the effect of colour can be used to predict in which regions of colour space the formulae fail. However, a word of caution is in order; large values of D may relate to failure of the model used to transform the visual data onto a measurable scale. The values of  $ \chi^{2} $  representing the fit of the model are, however, negatively correlated with the spread i.e. for very large values of  $ \chi^{2} $  the spread is likely to be small. We believe this indicates that values of  $ \chi^{2} $  cannot be used to assess the validity of the model. If this model is utilised in further work other tests of its validity should be looked for.

With this limitation in mind, the individual values of D were examined. We report only one comparison, that between the CIE 1976  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $  and  $ L^{*}u^{*}v^{*} $  formulae. For most colours, the ratios of the variances,  $ D^{2} $ , for the two formulae are not significantly different. For colour GY the spread is somewhat larger (significant at the 10% level) for the  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $  formula. But for colour SP the  $ L^{*}u^{*}v^{*} $  formula fails catastrophically, the ratio of the variances (5.33) being significant at the 0.1% level.

Table 10 gives the ratios of the variances,  $ D^{2} $ , for each of the other formulae, to the variance for the formula with the

smallest spread, namely CIE 1976  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $ . The significance levels of these ratios are difficult to calculate precisely because the number of degrees of freedom in the data (554) far exceeds that of the largest entry in the statistical tables, 120. However, a conservative estimate would be that there is less than 5% chance of the NBS or CIE 1964 formula being better than CIE 1976  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $ ; less than 10% chance of the FMC–1, FMC–2, or Reilly formulae being better, and less than 25% chance of the Hunter and CIE 1976  $ L^{*}u^{*}v^{*} $  being better. We estimate that even with 554 degrees of freedom, the differences amongst the CIE 1976  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $ , ANLAB 40, Scofield, and Saunderson–Milner formulae are not likely to be significant according to this test. Thus, we see no reason to prefer the more complicated calculations of the latter three over the CIE proposal.

## Slopes of the Regression Lines

Table 11 lists the slopes and intercepts of the regression lines for the nineteen individual colour ranges. Although values for any one colour, (calculated from different formulae) are not strictly comparable because of the differing sizes of the calculated colour differences, nevertheless some conclusions

can be drawn. One might ask, for example, whether the slope for colour SG is high because of unusual behaviour of all the formulae for this colour, or because of some aberration in the visual experiment? To some extent this is answered by examination of the data for colour DG, in the same area of chromaticity but at a lower luminance. Again the slopes are relatively high (apart from the CIE 1976  $ I \cdot a \cdot b \cdot b^{*} $ , ANLAB 40, and Scofield equations), though not as markedly so. Since the indices of colour change for these two samples are outstandingly small (Table 3), we rule out metamerism as a possible cause, and suggest the need for more experiments in the near-grey region.

## I ntercepts of the Regression Lines

The spread of the intercepts of the regression lines, on the axis of visual colour differences, (Figure 3 and Table 11) suggests the need for more experiments with smaller colour differences than those used in the present work. It would appear that the magnitude of difference on our visual scale, corresponding to the 'rejectable' difference on the accept–reject scale of the textile industry, is in our category -II; i.e. just noticeable difference. Because of the widely varying slopes of the regression lines, we suspect that the formulae which are best for our data, may not continue to give the best overall fit when a wider range of colour differences is examined.

## Effect of Saturation and Luminance

Attempts were made to prepare sample ranges at the same chromaticity but different levels of luminance. These attempts were not entirely satisfactory, but nonetheless samples FC, OC, and BC form a series with approximately constant hue, whilst luminance and saturation increase together. But Figure 3 and Table I show that, in most instances, the slopes for FC and BC are very similar, while that for OC is substantially different, especially for the formulae with highest overall correlation coefficients. Although, at first, one might suspect that the panel trials were somehow influenced by the organiser (which would not be too difficult in this category scaling experiment), Table 6 indicates that the category widths for these three colours were not very far from the mean value. It would seem surprising that the slightly greater width of category II for OC would have such a great effect.

While the evidence presented here is fragmentary, it suggests the need for more work, if only to repeat the observations reported and to study other colour ranges for which the slopes of the regression lines are unusual. Included amongst these are McB and MB, the two colours for which no estimate for the width of category II was possible because of the distribution of colour differences in these series.

## Luminance Weighting in the CIE 1976 L*a*b* Formula

In accord with the suggestion of the CIE Colorimetry Committee  $ [32] $ , we have explored the effect of changing the constant  $ c_{2} $ , which, in this formula, governs the relative weighting of chromaticity and lightness differences, on the correlation coefficients. The results are shown in Table 12. While the correlation coefficients increase with increasing lightness weighting, (increasing values of  $ c_{2} $ ) both for the overall correlation and most of the 19 colour ranges; they are nonetheless essentially independent of lightness for some colours (GY, PB, RO), and even decrease significantly for others (FC) or, as in the case of DG, they pass through a

maximum. Thus for most of our data the CIE 1976  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $  formula appears to underweight lightness, but both the magnitude and, even more importantly, the direction of the effect appear to differ from colour to colour. Our most prevalent result is opposite to that reported by Strocka [13], who showed that for acceptability data on textiles, most formulae, including ANLAB 40, overweight lightness.

## Concluding Remarks

This research was carried out under fairly rigorous physical conditions, one result of which has been to point out the importance of calculating the tristimulus values, of the samples, from the spectral power distribution of the light source used in the visual observations. Even so, not all the sources of error can have been eliminated. This emphasised both the need to understand the nature of panel trials and, most importantly, to evolve reliable methods of obtaining and processing the results of the visual estimates. In this paper we have explored some new methods; finding them far from perfect but yielding indications of the nature of their weaknesses. As is so often the case in colour science, examination of new disciplines such as psychology and statistics is indicated.

## The Hatra Data on Colour Differences and Visual Colour Passing [1-3]

Pressure of work has precluded the writing of a full paper including the above data and, although this is still my eventual intention, XYZ tristimulus values and visual acceptances out of 48, of the patterns and associated standards in the Combined Hatra-589 Group of patterns comprising 12 colour centres can now be made available on paper tape (ASCII code, ISO 8-track) to established investigators with a specific interest in the field of colour-difference formulae. This information is not in a sequence logically suitable for publication, but it is in a form useful for computation.

R. Appleyard (1870–1921). Appleyard, with his supervisor Professor (later Sir James) Walker, made what appears to be the first research into dyeing processes by modern physico-chemical methods (J. Chem. Soc., 1896, 69, 1334) (see my note in the paper on the Freundlich isotherm, J.S.D.C., 89 (1973), 287). Appleyard was then lecturer in dyeing at the University College, Dundee. He appears to have held the post from 1889 to 1898, when he moved to Salford as Head of the Department of Applied Chemistry at the Royal Technical Institute. There are obituary notices in J. Chem. Soc., 1922, 121, 2898, by Prof. E. Knecht; and also in this Journal (probably by the same writer), 38 (1922) 16, where he is described as chief lecturer in dyeing at Salford. He was born in Bradford and educated at the Grammar School and the Technical College there.

I should be glad to hear from any reader who could put me in touch with surviving members of Appleyard's family, from whom I might obtain additional information and a portrait. The University Library at Salford have searched their records, but cannot find much more information than is given in the obituary notices.
