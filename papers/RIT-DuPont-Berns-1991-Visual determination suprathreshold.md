# Visual Determination of Suprathreshold Color-Difference Tolerances Using Probit Analysis $ ^{\dagger} $ 

As part of a research program to improve the relationship between visual and numerical color-difference evaluation for industrial colorimetry, a color-difference tolerance data set for fitting and testing of color-difference metrics has been extended to include 156 individual color-tolerance determinations. These tolerances were designed to sample 19 color centers over a surface color gamut with balanced sampling of lightness and chromaticness differences. The tolerance determination procedures emphasized accurate estimation of population visual color-difference response and rigorous estimation of tolerance precision. Tolerance accuracy was confirmed by excellent agreement of these results and the majority of previous experiments on five color centers selected for CIE color-difference evaluations. The average uncertainty of the tolerance determinations was  $ \pm11\% $  of the tolerance value at a  $ 2\sigma $  level (95% confidence interval). The completed data set is suitable for estimating the parameters of color-difference metrics or testing the performance of such metrics. The color tolerances indicated the systematic lack of uniformity of the CIELAB space, in general agreement with previous experiments. A simple modification of the CIELAB color-difference metric was shown to account for much of the systematic lack of uniformity.

## I NTRODUCTION

A three-phase program of study has been undertaken to develop a color-tolerance data set for use in testing existing color-difference equations and developing new equations. The rationale for initiating this work was twofold. First, developing a color-difference equation requires adequate sampling of the color gamut of most man-made coloration systems. Many color-tolerance data sets used to evaluate and devise color-difference equations do not fulfill this requirement. Consequently, Luo and Rigg $ ^{1} $  used a combination of mathematical analyses and supplemental visual judgments to develop a combined data set with a common set.

of experimental parameters. From this data set, the  $ BFD(\ell:c) $  color-difference equation was developed. $ ^{2} $  Although their methodology was reasonable, inadequate data are available about how various experimental parameters affect tolerance judgments. These parameters include perceptibility or acceptability judgments, sample properties such as aperture or surface colors and textural effects (paints vs textiles), the range of magnitudes of the difference stimuli, experimental setup including sample separation and illuminating and viewing geometries, etc. These effects and others have been reviewed by Robertson. $ ^{3} $  Certain parameters may influence a color tolerance uniformly while others may affect only hue, lightness, or chroma. As a consequence, it is possible that pooling techniques produce systematic errors in the resultant combined data. Second, it is clear that current CIE color spaces do not adequately predict visual color-difference responses. McDonald's review $ ^{4,5} $  of the relationships between visual and instrumental assessment of color differences conveniently summarizes many of the problems of mathematically modeling difference perceptions. A new color space or a new color-difference equation derived by use of an existing CIE approximately uniform color space is needed to efficiently facilitate industrial color control. The  $ CMC(\ell:c)^{6,7} $  and  $ BFD(\ell:c) $  equations show great promise for improvement of existing CIE equations. However, there is still a need to gather more visual data in order to test those equations with a minimum of bias and, if those equations prove inadequate, to devise new equations, particularly if the color-difference equation would include adjustable coefficients dependent of viewing and illuminating parameters. Therefore our goal has been to design and perform a color-tolerance experiment that minimizes systematic errors (i.e., uses a single set of experimental parameters), adequately samples surface-color space to promote equation development and testing, and provides an additional database of visual color-difference judgments.

The first phase of this study (phase I) was completed and described by Alman et al. $ ^{8} $ . Five vector directions were sampled about 9 color positions yielding 45 color-tolerance vectors. A series of color-difference stimuli varying in magnitude along each vector was presented in random order to 50 color-normal observers. The visual task was to judge whether the color-difference stimulus was larger than (reject) or smaller than (accept) a comparison near-neutral color-difference anchor stimulus of 1.02 CIELAB color-difference units ( $ \Delta E_{ab}^{*} $ ). The frequency-of-rejection data for the 50 combined observations yielded sigmoidal response functions. These functions were analyzed using probit analysis, $ ^{9} $  a maximum-likelihood model that relates experimental response functions to probability-of-occurrence estimates. The statistical model fits the sigmoidal responses to a cumulative normal distribution and allows estimation of the tolerance and uncertainty of the tolerance at varying rejection probabilities. The most precise estimate is the tolerance at 50% rejection probability (i.e., the median tolerance, denoted T50). This corresponds to the color-difference value visually equivalent to the anchor color-difference pair. The probit model is similar to the logistic model recommended by the CIE $ ^{10} $  for analysis of surface colors; both models yield equivalent tolerances for large populations. $ ^{9} $  The advantage of probit analysis over logistic analysis is that parametric statistical techniques (e.g., mean, standard deviation) can be used easily to estimate uncertainties. Along with the T50 tolerance estimates, fiducial (approximately equivalent to a 95% confidence interval) limits are also calculated, which indicate how well the observational data fit a cumulative-normal distribution ( $ \chi^{2} $  test), the observational standard deviation, and the number of color-difference pairs used to sample a vector direction. Greater detail on this statistical technique and how it applies to color-difference scaling has been described previously by the present authors. $ ^{8} $  The statistical package SAS $ ^{11} $  was used for the probit analyses. The tolerances were precise with fiducial limits generally less than 10% of the measured response. The corresponding color tolerances were used to evaluate the performance of CIE color-difference equations and other equations based on color-vision models or  $ CIE L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $ . Equations that differently weight  $ \Delta L^{*} $ ,  $ \Delta C_{ab}^{*} $ , and  $ \Delta H_{ab}^{*} $  performed better (probability greater than 0.99) than either CIELAB or CIELUV.

The purpose of this article is to describe the second phase of the study where the remainder of surface-color space and additional vectors about the phase I color positions were sampled and visually evaluated. Additional details of the work can be found in Refs. 12–14.

## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

The nine phase I color centers were positioned on a tilted plane in CIELAB space and included the five color centers recommended by the CIE for study. $ ^{10} $  Five color centers were added above this plane (higher  $ L^{*} $  values) and five color centers were added below (lower  $ L^{*} $  values). These color centers sampled the color gamut of the acrylic-lacquer paint system used in this study. An effort was made to include near-white and black positions.

The five vector directions about each color center in phase I varied independently in lightness and chromaticness $ ^{*} $  ( $ a^{*} $  and  $ b^{*} $ ). By use of the visual tolerances determined with this sampling scheme, it is not possible to determine interaction between these two colorimetric dimensions. Such interaction would indicate whether and how an ellipsoid is tilted in color space. Although most published results have indicated a lack of interaction (e.g., the BFD equation $ ^{2} $ ) we desired data with which to test the possibility. For this purpose, two of the vector directions used in phase I, in which  $ a^{*} $  and  $ b^{*} $  varied simultaneously (identified as vector directions D and E), were replaced by four vector directions varying simultaneously in  $ L^{*} $ ,  $ a^{*} $ , and  $ b^{*} $ , as shown in Fig. 1. These are identified as vector directions F, G, H, and I. The remaining original three vector directions used in phase

I were retained and are shown in Fig. 2. Seven vector directions thus sampled each of the phase II color centers. Additional samples were also prepared to sample the four new vector directions (Fig. 1) for the phase I color centers. Thus 106 new vector directions required tolerance determination.

The same coatings system and sample-preparation methods used in phase I to generate color-difference pairs were used for the present research. An acrylic-lacquer automotive coating was sprayed onto primed aluminum panels. The resulting high-gloss finish exhibited a small amount of "orange peel," typical of sprayed surfaces. Several panels were measured using a BYK Gardner Glossgard II 60° glossmeter. Their average value was 90. Distinctness-of-image measurements also were made using a Hunterlab Dori-Gon D47-6 abridged goniophotometer. Values ranged between

80 and 88, depending on the extent and size of the "orange peel" textural pattern. Samples were cut into 6.5 by 5.0 cm² rectangles from the sprayed panels using a hydraulic sheet metal cutter; only samples free from edge defects were used from which to fashion difference pairs. The cut samples were mounted edge to edge on unprimed aluminum panels forming color-difference pairs, as shown in Fig. 3. The color-difference pair subtended a rectangular visual field of 10° by 3.8°. Each sample forming these color-difference pairs was measured by use of a Milton Roy Colorscan/45 spectrophotometer, an instrument with circumferential 45/0 geometry. Software based on Berns and Petersen $ ^{16} $  was used to correct residual systematic spectrophotometric errors. The average CIELAB colorimetric error for a set of BCRA Series II ceramic tiles measured on this instrument, corrected to minimize systematic errors, and compared to their calibration values supplied by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, was 0.2. CIELAB coordinates were calculated for CIE Illuminant D65 and the CIE 1964 standard observer by use of the ASTM method E-308-85. $ ^{17} $  Principal component analyses using SAS software $ ^{11} $  were carried out to define each vector direction and to verify the sampling design in which color tolerances were required to vary in single vector directions in CIELAB color space.

Fifty observers judged seven color-difference pairs for each vector direction in the phase I experiments, a total of 315 color-difference pairs. This corresponds to 742 color-difference pairs to scale in the present experiment. We desired to reduce the number of judgments, if possible. Examination of each frequency-of-rejection sigmoid from phase I revealed that for about half of the vectors, the smallest and largest color-difference pair was accepted or rejected, respectively, by all of the observers. By definition, these values correspond to normal deviates of negative or positive infinity and are ignored when the maximum-likelihood estimates are calculated and rejection frequencies are trans-

formed to probabilities. In these cases, the number of judgments of color-difference pairs could have been reduced from 7 to 5 without loss of accuracy of location of the median tolerance. Furthermore, maximum-likelihood estimates are weighted towards the median location; in cases in which all seven samples were used but in which the largest- and smallest-difference pairs were near rejection frequencies of 0 and 1, respectively, the tolerance value determined by use of either seven or five samples would have been nearly identical. Thus, if we could reduce the number of color-difference pairs sampling each vector direction from 7 to 5, the total number of samples to judge could be reduced to 530.

However, the omission of two of the difference pairs must not cause the median tolerance to fall outside the range of the five remaining difference pairs. A pilot study, using 21 observers, was performed to determine the approximate median tolerance, T50, to guide the final sampling. Pilot results that had high statistical confidence were used to define five different pairs; results that had lower confidence levels were used to define six or seven difference pairs. The approximate T50 was used to select samples at postulated frequencies of rejection, 0.2, 0.35, 0.5, 0.65, and 0.8 in cases of five difference pairs. Vectors sampled by six or seven difference pairs were spaced between 0.1 and 0.9.

A further consequence of the sampling reduction is a loss of the number of degrees of freedom. The total number of degrees of freedom in probit analysis is the number of samples minus two. The number of degrees of freedom are used in the  $ \chi^{2} $  test and in determining the fiducial limits. When the number of degrees of freedom is reduced, the criteria for evaluating Gaussian-population behavior and in setting total-uncertainty limits become more stringent. Thus, relative to the phase I sampling scheme, the sample reduction from seven to six or five, in general, will not bias the determination of the median tolerance but might adversely affect the confidence limits for the median tolerance.

The goal of the entire experimental program was to develop a single data base. In order to pool the phase I and II results, statistical verification was required that the two sets of 50 observations were representative of the same population. The five phase I vectors from the moderate-bluish-green color center (labeled "Green" in Ref. 8) were reevaluated by the phase II observers. If the five tolerances for the repeated vectors were not statistically different from the previously published results, the two studies could be pooled. The number of difference pairs was reduced from 7 to 5 for the moderate-bluish-green color center as well. The phase I results were used to decide which samples to eliminate.

Eight of the 45 vectors tolerated in phase I failed the  $ \chi^{2} $  test with an  $ \alpha $  of 0.05. For these vectors, the phase I pilot experiment did not determine the approximate T50 locations. They therefore caused improper sampling along the frequency-of-rejection sigmoid. New samples were prepared and those vectors were also evaluated in the present experiment.

In total, 119 vectors, corresponding to 642 color-difference pairs, were scaled in a manner similar to the phase I experiment. The difference pairs were placed in random order and divided into three portions, for use in three observational sessions. The order of the three presentations and the order of the pairs within the presentations in were randomized. This yielded 48 possible combinations. Fifty color-normal observers, who had passed screening with pseudoisochromatic plates, judged the magnitudes of each difference pair relative to the same near-neutral anchor pair as was used in phase I. The colorimetric values for the anchor pair were as follows: sample 1:  $ L^{*} = 49.53 $ ,  $ a^{*} = -0.08 $ ,  $ b^{*} = -5.65 $ ; and sample 2:  $ L^{*} = 48.89 $ ,  $ a^{*} = 0.17 $ ,  $ b^{*} = -4.90 $ ;  $ \Delta E_{ab}^{*} = 1.02 $ . The primed aluminum panel to which the color-difference pairs were affixed had average colorimetric values of  $ L^{*} = 38 $ ,  $ a^{*} = -1 $ ,  $ b^{*} = -1 $ . The observers had an average age of 28.5 years with a standard deviation of 7.7 years. The majority of observers were graduate students, professors, and secretaries. Observers were instructed to judge whether the color-difference magnitude of a test pair was larger or smaller than that of the anchor pair. Observations were performed in a Macbeth Spectralight booth with a black cloth covering the back wall and the bottom of the booth covered with a mat paper equivalent to Munsell value N4 ( $ L^{*} = 39.4 $ ,  $ a^{*} = 0.9 $ ,  $ b^{*} = 1.5 $ ). The test color-difference pair was positioned next to the anchor color-difference pair as shown in Fig. 3. The correlated color temperature of the simulated daylight was 6100 K with an illuminance of 2000 lx on the sample plane.

## I NTRAOBSERVER UNCERTAINTY

Early analyses of the phase II visual experiment revealed greater experimental uncertainty compared to the phase I results, as indicated by an increase of  $ \chi^{2} $  values. In 55% of the computed response vectors, the values were not significant, with an  $ \alpha $  of 0.05; 17% of the phase I vectors yielded large  $ \chi^{2} $  values at the same  $ \alpha $ . The surprisingly large number of high  $ \chi^{2} $  values indicated that the experimental data were not fitting the model of a cumulative-normal distribution, either due to poor sampling or fluctuating data.

In a few cases there were sampling problems. The pilot results did not locate the approximate T50. As a consequence, the five to seven color-difference pairs did not encompass the median tolerance but towards one end of the sigmoid, where the maximum-likelihood estimate had the least sensitivity. As previously discussed, eight of the 45 phase I vectors were repeated in the phase II experiment for the same reason.

The remaining vectors exhibited poor fits because of an increase of judgment imprecision. Study of the judgments of each observer showed a large increase of nonmonotonic behavior. The underlying statistical model assumed individual observer responses such as those that are shown in Fig. 4 by the solid triangles connected by a solid line. All color-difference pairs judged to be lesser in magnitude than the anchor pair are accepted; all color-difference pairs judged to be greater than the anchor pair are rejected. Many observers exhibited behavior like those shown by the open

circles connected by the dashed line in Fig. 4. The color-difference pair with a $\Delta E_{ab}^{*}$ of 1.1 was rejected, whereas the neighboring difference pairs with $\Delta E_{ab}^{*}$ values of 0.9 and 1.3 were both accepted.

There were three suspected causes for the lack of monotonic behavior in the phase II experimental results, as compared with phase I: different vector directions, color-center locations relative to the anchor-pair location, and observation time.

The phase I vector directions sampled lightness and chromaticness separately; in phase II, there were vector directions sampling these dimensions separately and together. Wyszecki has noted $ ^{18} $  that discrimination studies that have stimuli varying in both lightness and chromaticness are much more difficult to judge than pairs that differ in only one of those dimensions. Coates et al. $ ^{19} $  found similar trends. Conversely, Strocka et al. $ ^{20} $  found that direction did not contribute to differences of observer uncertainty. In the present study, observer uncertainty is quantified by the magnitude of the  $ \chi^{2} $  associated with each vector. The  $ \chi^{2} $  values were grouped by vector direction for each phase and are listed in Table I. As the  $ \chi^{2} $  value increases, the observer uncertainty increases. It is very interesting that in both phases, observers had difficulty judging differences of lightness (vector direction A) compared to judgments of differences of only chromaticness (vector directions B, C, D, and E) with the exception of vector direction C for the phase I results. Because the visual system responds better to luminous contrast than isoluminous chromatic contrast (for which reason the U.S. television standards provide the greatest bandwidth to the luminance signal), the opposite result was expected. However, we should remember that the samples defined for the vector A direction were primarily chromatic. The phase II data show that vector directions that varied simultaneously

in lightness and chromaticness (vector directions F, G, H, and I) were more difficult to judge than those that varied in only chromaticness. Dunnett's multiple comparison test $ ^{21} $  was applied to the logarithm of the  $ \chi^{2} $  values to test these trends statistically. The logarithm was calculated to improve the normality of the data. At  $ \alpha = 0.05 $ , phase I vector direction A was significantly different than vector direction E but not significantly different than the other chromatic vector directions. For phase II, vector directions B and C were significantly different than vector directions A, F, G, H, and I, consistent with Wyszecki's observations and the suspicion that simultaneously sampling lightness and chromaticness increased observation uncertainty.

Strocka $ ^{20} $  also reported that observer uncertainty increased as the color difference increased between the anchor pair color-space location and the test pair location. The average CIELAB color difference between each phase I color-center location and the anchor pair location was 28 units; the average color difference for the phase II locations was 41 units. Analysis of the  $ \chi^{2} $  probabilities and the population standard deviations revealed trends in the present research similar to those reported by Strocka. Thus the intraobserver uncertainty and the interobserver differences were greater in the phase II results than in the phase I results, due to inherent differences of color-center locations between the two phases.

Observation time was also thought to be contributory to increased intraobserver uncertainty. In the phase I experiment, difference pairs to be scaled were divided into 4 observation sessions, each lasting from 15 to 20 minutes. In phase II, the experiment was divided into 3 sessions, each lasting from 40 to 45 minutes. From previous experience, sessions up to one hour long have been considered acceptable; beyond that time, fatigue is a factor and lack of motivation may compromise the reliability of judgments. The phase I judgments were reported to be very easy in postobservation interviews. All the observers felt that increasing the duration of the observation session was reasonable.

sonable and preferred to increasing the number of sessions. Reduction of the number of sessions was also desired to ease scheduling problems. If the phase II samples had been identical to the phase I samples, the time increase probably would not have changed the reported results. However, in phase II, there were two major differences as previously stated. The vector directions sampled lightness and chromaticness simultaneously, and the color centers were farther from the anchor pair. Both of these differences increased experimental difficulty. In addition, the more difficult visual task certainly resulted in some observers taking more time to make their decisions. This might have caused an increase of local adaptation for both the test pair and the reference pair. This would also increase the judgment uncertainty. Some observers stated that the magnitude difference of the anchor pair seemed to vary through the experiment, indicating an effect of local adaptation.

A supplemental experiment was performed to evaluate observation time directly. The moderate-bluish-green color center scaled in both phases I and II and the phase II light-bluish-green were used in this experiment. The samples were identical to those used in phase II. The light-bluish-green center was selected for two reasons. The first reason was that judgments of four of the seven vectors investigated in phase II had high uncertainty. Second, this color center was one of the color centers farthest from the anchor-pair location. The 75 difference pairs were randomized and presented to 50 color-normal observers in a fashion identical to that used in both phases I and II. The experiment took about 15 minutes to perform. Ideally, the 50 observers should not have participated in either phase I or II. Practically, this was not possible; more than half of the observers also performed the phase II experiment. The separation in time was six months. This experiment will be referred to as phase II-S.

Evaluating the probit analyses revealed that the phase II-S median tolerances were not statistically different than the phase II or phase I (for the moderate-bluish-green color center) tolerances with an  $ \alpha $  of 0.05. The same result was found for the standard deviations. However, the standard deviations tended to increase in the order: phase I, phase II-S, and phase II. This trend probably corresponds to experimental difficulty; certainly, the phase II judgments were the most difficult. The statistical similarity for the three experiments led to the conclusion that observation time did not adversely influence the major objective of these visual experiments, to collect accurate visual tolerances with their associated uncertainties.

Evaluation of the frequency-of-rejection data and the  $ \chi^{2} $  values revealed that the phase II-S observations were the most imprecise of the three experiments, as indicated by a large number of nonmonotonic responses. It was suspected that the phase II-S observers who also had participated in the phase II experiments were less motivated. There was a tendency for unreliable observations; tolerance judgments were often nonmonotonic. Even so, these differences were not statistically significantly at an  $ \alpha $  of 0.05. Thus the phase II-S experiment indicates that the increase of observation

time in the phase II experiment compared to phase I did not significantly contribute to observer uncertainty. However, it is likely that the increase of experimental difficulty reduced observer motivation. Future experiments of such scale and sampling scheme should be designed so that the interest and motivation of the observers is maintained.

Ordinarily, excessive observer uncertainty is combatted by increasing the number of observations so that the median estimate has a higher probability of representing the true population median. This was tested for the moderate-bluish-green color center by combining the observational results of phases II and II-S and the phase II pilot experiment, yielding 121 judgments. Probit analyses were performed on the combined data and the results are compared to the phase II results in Table II. The median tolerances, T50, for the two data sets are very similar; the average value for this color center is unchanged, and for a single vector the greatest difference was 0.2.

The standard deviations are also very similar. T tests performed on these median tolerances and the logarithms of the standard deviations statistically substantiated their similarities with an  $ \alpha $  of 0.05. Thus the measured tolerances for the phase II observations are representative of the true population tolerance. Although the results with the 121 observations were similar to the results with 50 observations, the intraobserver uncertainty was much larger for the 121 observations. The observers who performed phases II and II-S tended to make nonmonotonic responses as described above. This result points out the difficulty in striking the proper balance between the number of tolerance pairs to judge, the number of observers, and the number of replicate observations. The conclusion from these analyses was that performing additional visual observations would not increase either precision or accuracy.

For precise estimates of population tolerances and standard deviations (interobserver differences), intraobserver uncertainty needs to be minimized to minimize possible bias in these estimates. If the visual data are nonmonotonic, the maximum-likelihood estimate may be incorrect, particularly if the data reversals are near the median tolerance. The estimate of the maximum-likelihood line could be skewed, which would cause an error of the standard

deviation estimate and a possible error of the median tolerance location.

A low-pass filter algorithm was devised to reduce intraobserver uncertainty and alleviate the problem of possibly skewing the maximum-likelihood estimates. The algorithm was made computationally simple so as to make changes only on the basis of gross intraobserver differences such as nonmonotonic responses. The algorithm was applied on a vector by vector basis for each observer. The algorithm is shown in Fig. 5. Ordered lists of responses were created for each vector. The order was determined by the size of the color difference of the associated samples. Using the number zero (0) to refer to an acceptance (test color-difference pair judged smaller in color difference than the anchor pair), and the number one (1) to refer to a rejection (test color-difference pair judged larger in color difference than the anchor pair), the visual data were transformed to integer values. Next, a zero was appended preceding the first entry and a one was appended following the last entry. These choices for appended end points were made based on the assumption that any color difference smaller than the smallest test color-difference pair would tend to be accepted and any color difference larger than the largest test color-difference pair would tend to be rejected. Finally, each three contiguous responses was summed and integer divided by two. In this way, the algorithm allows two of the three original responses to determine the value of the filtered response.

As an example, the filtering algorithm was applied to the nonmonotonic observation set shown in Fig. 4 by the open circles. Figure 5 indicates the operation of the filter. The resulting filtered data are plotted in Fig. 4 as solid triangles.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## Analysis of Numerical Information

The filtering algorithm was applied to the visual results from both phases I and II. Although the phase I visual results had inherent high precision, the filtering algorithm also was applied to these results for uniformity of practice between the two experiments. The algorithm was designed to reduce intraobserver uncertainty while retaining interobserver differences. In addition, the filter should not alter the median tolerance estimates except where intraobserver uncertainty would bias these estimates as discussed above. The algorithm's affect on median tolerances is shown in Fig. 6, where the T50 tolerances before filtering are plotted against the T50 tolerances after filtering for the phase I data. Because the phase I visual results had high precision, their tolerances should be unaltered. The fitted regression line is indicative of the filter's lack of tolerance effect for data with low intraobserver uncertainty. The regression line is effectively a straight line.

The effects of the filter algorithm on the phase II data are shown in Fig. 7 where the tolerance differences are plotted against the tolerances before filtering. A difference plot is shown to better illustrate the changes. In this case the tol-

erances for some of the sampled vectors are dramatically changed. The intraobserver uncertainty biased the maximum-likelihood estimates. By reducing this uncertainty, the after-filtered median tolerances are more representative of the true population tolerances.

The moderate-bluish-green color center was evaluated by both phase I and phase II observers, to facilitate pooling of the visual results. Recall that for phase II, the number of difference pairs that sampled each vector direction was reduced from seven to five. The median tolerance estimates,

standard deviations, and  $ \chi^{2} $  probabilities for this color center are listed in Table III. The two populations were remarkably similar in determining tolerances. Their differences were not statistically different with an  $ \alpha $  of 0.05 when analyzed either by individual vector (n = 50) or by total number of vectors (n = 5). On the basis of this result, pooling of the two experiments is reasonable. In addition, the premise that reducing the number of samples from seven to five when the approximate median tolerance is known was a reasonable procedure. It is clear that using the judgments of 50 observers improves the likelihood that these estimates are close to the true population tolerances.

The population standard deviations were significantly different in the two phases, which indicate the inherent differences of the two phases. For phase I, the average standard deviation (S) was 0.32, whereas for phase II it was 0.50. This was true on whole for the entire experiment. In phase II, the observers had a larger variance of difference judgments than in phase I. This variance increase seems to be due to the same factors that increased intraobserver uncertainty in the phase II observations.

The $\chi^{2}$ probabilities (P:CHISQ) indicate how well the frequency-of-rejection data fit a cumulative-normal distribution. Only one vector, the phase II vector D, had a poor fit; the $\chi^{2}$ probability of 0.01 was less than 0.05. Even after filtering, the 50 observers responded summarily in a non-monotonic fashion for this vector.

Table IV (see Appendix) summarizes the results of the entire visual experiment. Column 1 lists the ISCC-NBS color name for each color center.* These color names are different than those previously reported. $ ^{8} $  The five color centers recommended by the CIE for study are indicated by asterisks. Column 2 lists the vector direction. Column 3 lists whether the data originate from phase I or phase II. Eight of the 45 vectors from phase I were reevaluated. If the phase II results had higher precision, the phase I results were replaced by the phase II results. Seven of the eight

vectors were replaced in this manner. The next five columns list the median tolerances (T50), the lower fiducial limits (LFL), the upper fiducial limits (UFL), the population standard deviations (S), and the  $ \chi^{2} $  probabilities (P:CHISQ). The position in color space and the vector direction for each sample series are specified by the  $ L^{*} $ ,  $ a^{*} $ ,  $ b^{*} $  location for each color center and the eigenvectors  $ \Delta L^{*} $ ,  $ \Delta a^{*} $ , and  $ \Delta b^{*} $ . The eigenvalues for the first characteristic vector associated with the principal components analysis used to define the vector directions are listed in the last column. In all but a few cases, the fraction of the directional variance is greater than 0.99, which verifies the sampling requirement of unidimensional changes in the CIELAB three space. At the bottom of Table IV, general statistics are shown including the minimum and maximum values, the mean, and the standard deviation.

The anchor color-difference pair to which all color-difference pairs were visually compared had a CIELAB color difference of 1.02. If CIELAB adequately describes color tolerances of this specific visual magnitude, the fiducial limits should encompass the value 1.02 for tolerances with a  $ \chi^{2} $  probability of greater than 0.05. Qualitatively, the mean T50 would also be expected to be 1.02 with a very small range of values. It is obvious that this is not the case. The arithmetic average T50 was 1.44 with a minimum of 0.78 and a maximum of 4.4. The geometric average and standard deviation was 1.37 and 1.35, respectively. Therefore CIELAB does not accurately estimate visual tolerances of this magnitude. This, of course, is not surprising.

The goal of these experiments was to determine visual color tolerances accurately and precisely. Although accuracy is difficult to quantify, precision is not. The precision of the tolerances is evaluated by the associated fiducial limits. Fiducial limits are, in effect, asymmetric 95% confidence limits (i.e.,  $ 2\sigma $  level). We can think of plotting color differences versus probabilities (probit units) as a straight line. Fiducial limits produce two hyperbolic curves convex to the line while approaching the line most closely at the 50% probability point. The 50% probability point corresponds to the median color tolerance. Because of the convexity, a line at constant probability but varying in color difference would produce upper and lower limits asymmetric around the mean value. Fiducial limits near the median point exhibit the greatest symmetry. However, when the fiducial limits are large, the asymmetry is easily observed. Fiducial limits are calculated from the population standard deviation, fit to a cumulative normal distribution, and the number of difference pairs used to describe the frequency-of-rejection sigmoid. Probit analysis employs the hypothesis that frequency-of-rejection data follow a cumulative-normal distribution. The  $ \chi^{2} $  test is used to test this hypothesis. The critical value in the  $ \chi^{2} $  test depends on the number of degrees of freedom, the number of color-difference pairs minus two. For these experiments, the degrees of freedom ranged between 3 and 5. The  $ \chi^{2} $  values were transformed into probabilities depending on the number of degrees of freedom. The probability of 0.05 was used as

the critical value;  $ \chi^{2} $  probabilities of greater than 0.05 indicate that the visual data were well fitted by a cumulative normal distribution. Seventy-nine percent of the visual results satisfied this criterion. The specific values for the visual results are listed in Table IV, in the column headed by P:CHISQ. For these tolerances, the fiducial limits are calculated using the standard deviation and a t value based on infinite degrees of freedom (t = 1.96). For those tolerances in which the rejection frequencies were not well fitted by a cumulative normal distribution, a heterogeneity factor was used as a multiplier in the fiducial-limit calculation and the t value was based on the actual degrees of freedom (e.g., for 3 degrees of freedom, t = 3.18 for  $ \alpha = 0.05 $ ). Heterogeneity refers to two types of heterogeneous behavior: random or systematic. Systematic error would be associated with poor sampling in the experimental design. In phase I, the eight tolerances that required reevaluation in phase II exemplified systematic errors. In the experimental results shown in the present article, 33 of the 156 tolerances (21%) required a heterogeneity factor. For those tolerances, random fluctuations decreased the fits to cumulative-normal distributions, rather than indicating systematic imperfections of sampling design. Although the intraobserver uncertainty was filtered, interobserver uncertainty could still be present due to the same causes for the intraobserver uncertainty. This uncertainty is manifested by both an increase of standard deviation and greater incidences of population nonmonotonic behavior. Because the lack of fit was due to random effects, it was reasonable to apply the heterogeneity factor. When the causes are systematic, further experiments are called for. Heterogeneity factors are calculated as  $ \chi^{2} $  values divided by the number of degrees of freedom. Thus the fiducial limits include the influence of lack of fit to a cumulative-normal distribution, where appropriate, and are correct estimates of the uncertainty of each of the 156 tolerances.

The lower fiducial limits (LFL) and upper fiducial limits (UFL) are listed in Table IV next to the median tolerances, T50. Four of the 156 tolerances do not have fiducial limits; for these tolerances, heterogeneity and the particular standard deviations caused by the fiducial limits to have values of negative and positive infinity. Even so, the T50 values are not unreasonable. A simple calculation evaluated the fiducial limits as a percentage of the color tolerance. For the 152 tolerances with fiducial limits, the average fiducial limits were  $ \pm11\% $  of the measured color tolerances. Excluding tolerances with  $ \chi^{2} $  probabilities less than or equal to 0.05 (probabilities not requiring the use of a heterogeneity factor), the fiducial limits were, on the average,  $ \pm7\% $  of the measured tolerances. Nearly 80% of the measured tolerances had fiducial limits less than or equal to  $ \pm10\% $  of the measured tolerances.

Conceptually, fiducial limits are equivalent to standard error multiplied by 2, because 95% confidence is twice the standard error. The most recent visual experiment in which a large region of color space was sampled was that by Luo and Rigg. $ ^{1} $  They reported a standard error of  $ \pm9\% $  and used

 $ \pm $ 10% in their computation of ellipse reliability. That level of uncertainty would correspond to fiducial limits of  $ \pm $ 18% and  $ \pm $ 20% assuming that a heterogeneity factor need not be applied. Comparing these values to the current results of  $ \pm $ 7% indicates the high precision of our experiment.

## Comparisons with Previous Research

For a given vector, samples used to form color-difference pairs were selected randomly in both positive and negative directions relative to a color center. Thus color-difference pairs varied in a single vector direction but were not fashioned typically as a single standard with many test samples. Therefore a unique standard was not associated with each vector. However, samples were formulated to match color-orimetrically the aim color center. In many cases these samples were used to form a color-difference pair although inclusion of them was not required. These color-center samples were always added to the principal component analyses so that a standard could be defined along a vector direction. The principal component (sometimes called the scalar) for the color-center sample was used to calculate the coordinates of each vector's color center. These values are listed in Table IV in columns 9–11. Within the small portion of color space containing a color tolerance, CIELAB was assumed to be uniform. Therefore it was assumed that tolerances were symmetric about the color center. For each median tolerance, two sets of colorimetric coordinates could be calculated about each vector's color center. For example, to calculate the  $ L^{*} $  coordinates of the two test samples, the T50 tolerance is multiplied by the  $ \Delta L^{*} $  eigenvector value and either added to or subtracted from the  $ L^{*} $  value of the color center. The analogous procedure was used for the  $ a^{*} $  and  $ b^{*} $  coordinates. The 156 visual tolerances can be used to calculate 312 color tolerances, each visually equivalent to the near gray anchor pair.

Most studies of visual measurements of color differences report tolerance ellipsoids in x, y, Y space or ellipses in x, y space. Chromaticity ellipses or ellipsoids are usually used to compare results from different studies with the majority reporting tolerances ellipses. We calculated such ellipses to compare our results with previous studies. The CIELAB coordinates for the tolerances corresponding to the five CIE color centers $ ^{10} $  were transformed to chromaticities  $ (x, y) $ . Vectors B, C, D, and E, which vary only in chromaticness, were used in these analyses. From the 16 chromaticities (eight tolerance locations plus eight color-center locations), eight  $ \Delta x $  and  $ \Delta y $  chromaticities were determined. It was necessary to use the  $ \Delta x $  and  $ \Delta y $  values rather than the eight tolerance chromaticities because the eight color centers did not exactly coincide.

Each tolerance also has a precision estimate, quantified by its fiducial limits. In weighted regression analysis, the reciprocal of the variance associated with each observation is sometimes used to weight the least-squares minimization. $ ^{23} $  Observations that are less reliable (larger variance) thus are given smaller influence on the regression. Although population standard deviations were calculated in the present

experiment, the fiducial limits are more appropriate uncertainty estimates because their magnitude also depends on how well the visual observations are estimated with a cumulative-normal distribution response. Analogous to reciprocal variance weighting, a weight was calculated for each tolerance by use of Eq. 1:

 $$  Weight=\frac{1}{\left(\frac{UFL-LFL}{T50}\right)^{2}}. $$ 

The fiducial limits were normalized by each corresponding tolerance (T50) because of the nonuniformity of CIELAB. The denominator was squared analogously to squaring standard deviations to yield variances.

The  $ g_{11} $ ,  $ g_{12} $ , and  $ g_{22} $  coefficients that define an ellipse were estimated by use of a simplex algorithm available among the nonlinear-optimization subroutines in the Systat $ ^{24} $  statistics software package. The coefficients typically are estimated that minimize the sum-of-squares of the differences between the response variable (colorimetric tolerance) and the estimate of the response variable (ellipse representative). A weighted least-squares optimization was implemented by multiplying each squared tolerance difference by the weight calculated from Eq. 1. Tolerances with smaller normalized fiducial limits had greater influence on fitting the ellipse. The fitted ellipses along with the chromaticity vectors are shown in the lower right-hand corner of Figs. 8–12. By coincidence, the vectors reasonably sampled the ellipses with the exception of the CIE blue color center. Many more data points are required to fit an ellipse with high confidence.

Robertson $ ^{25} $  compared chromaticity discrimination ellipses from MacAdam, $ ^{26} $  Wyszecki and Fielder, $ ^{27} $  Witt and Döring, $ ^{28} $  Witt, $ ^{29} $  Strocka et al., $ ^{20} $  and Cheung and Rigg $ ^{30} $  for the five CIE color centers. The Witt and Döring data was used for the green color center. The Strocka data only was used for the red color center. Witt subdivided his data according to Friedman ranking procedures in order to define two types of observers: severe and lenient; Witt's ellipses for both observer types are plotted. The ellipse parameters for MacAdam, and Wyszecki and Fielder were calculated by Robertson $ ^{25} $  by linearly interpolating the published (Refs. 26 and 27) a, b, and  $ \theta $  values from nearby ellipses. Ellipses from those previous studies and the present work were normalized to equal area in order to confine attention to differences of ellipse orientations. The ellipses are shown in Figs. 8–12. The ellipses from the present experiments are plotted with the bold line. The agreement in orientation is quite close between these studies with the exception of MacAdam's interpolated red, yellow, green, and blue ellipses, Wyszecki and Fielder's interpolated green ellipse, and Cheung and Rigg's yellow ellipse. (It is unknown how the interpolation techniques affected the accuracy of MacAdam and Wyszecki and Fielder's ellipses.) Our results are in excellent agreement with the majority of ellipse orientations. It appears that our ellipses are similar to the other investigations and presumably the true population. Except for the noted exceptions, the ellipses are within the intraobserver and interobserver variability estimated by Witt $ ^{29} $  using Monte Carlo techniques. Judging from this very close agreement with previous experiments, we consider our tolerance data base accurate.

## Data Visualization

Many researchers involved in color tolerance experiments represent their results in x,y,y space. Accordingly, we plotted our color-tolerance results as a series of three-dimensional views in x,y,y space. They are plotted in Fig. 13. The vectors are magnified 5 times. Each color center was colored equivalent to its appearance under D65 illumination based on CIELAB coordinates as closely as possible within the color gamut of the film. Fig. 13(a) is a top view that represents the typical view of a chromaticity diagram. The axes are scaled between 0 and 1. The orientation is similar to those of the chromaticity ellipses published by Luo and Rigg, $ ^{1} $  who combined many experiments into a single data set. The techniques they used to combine data sets did not affect ellipse orientation. Vector-length elongation coincides with ellipse orientation. In Fig. 13, x,y,y space was assumed to form an orthogonal three-space or cube with the origin of the three-space at one corner of the cube. These images represent those recorded by a “camera” located far from the cube “photographing” the tolerance vectors in the cube from four locations around the cube. In Figs. 13(b)–13(e), the x,y,y cube is oriented so that the luminance factor axis Y is vertical and the chromaticity axes x and y are horizontal, into, and out of the plane of the page. The top right-hand drawing in Fig. 13 indicates the orientation of the various views. The flattening of the vectors as luminance factor decreases is a consequence of the transformation between  $ L^{*},a^{*},b^{*} $  and x,y,y. The large change of tolerance length as luminance factor varies indicates the large nonuniformity of x,y,y space. These figures provide an indication of the need for the  $ 13L^{*} $  multiplier in the CIELUV  $ u^{*}v^{*} $  equations. In view of the obvious nonuniformities, it is unclear why the CIE guidelines $ ^{10} $  have suggested that this space be used for calculating ellipsoids. Visual tolerances collected to optimize ellipsoid fits in x,y,y space may be less than optimal when the same visual data are used to fit ellipsoids in approximately uniform spaces or physiological-based spaces. Boynton has noted this limitation and found that, in some cases, diamonds rather than ellipses yielded better data fits. $ ^{31} $  He has suggested that visual tolerances be measured along the physiologically based red-green exchange axis and blue excitation axis for constant luminance stimuli in order to gather insight into the physiological basis for color discrimination. $ ^{32} $  In our work, CIELAB was used in the experimental design to sample color space. CIELAB’s approximate uniformity minimized these noted limitations. It is interesting that many of the longer tolerance vectors shown in Fig. 13(a) point towards the copunctal points supporting Boynton’s hypothesis. It is critical that visual tolerances and associated colorimetric coordinates rather than summarized tolerance ellipsoids be used to develop or test color-difference equations to eliminate these deficiencies.

Figure 14 contains various projections of the tolerance vectors magnified five times in  $ L^{*}, a^{*}, b^{*} $  space. The “camera” has zoomed in eliminating the strong-orange-yellow color center from the figures. [The strong-orange-yellow color center is located in the most upper right-hand region in Fig. 13(a)]. Figure 14(a) is a top view showing the typical  $ a^{*}b^{*} $  projection. The remaining four views [Figs. 14(b)–14(e) show  $ L^{*} $  on the vertical axis and either  $ a^{*} $  or  $ b^{*} $  on the horizontal axis. The drawing contained in Fig. 14 is a top view indicating the “camera” orientation for each view.

Examining the top view [Fig. 14(a)] shows that eight vectors are visible for the nine phase I color centers and six vectors are observed for the phase II color centers. In this projection, the lightness vector direction A is not observed. Recall that four of the vector directions (F, G, H, I) vary in  $ L^{*} $  in addition to varying in  $ a^{*} $  and  $ b^{*} $ . The overwhelming trend in the data is that the tolerance vectors are largest when oriented toward the origin. Differences of CIELAB chroma produced smaller visual responses than equivalent differences in CIELAB hue. The magnitudes also increased as the CIELAB chroma of the color center increased. Furthermore, the vectors that correspond to CIELAB hue changes increased with increasing CIELAB chroma. These trends are similar to those found in the many visual-tolerance experiments summarized by Luo and Rigg $ ^{2} $  and support color-difference equations proposed by McLaren, $ ^{33} $  McDonald, $ ^{34} $  J & P Coates, $ ^{35} $  and the recent Society of Dyers and Colourists CMC( $ \ell:c $ ) equation. $ ^{6,7} $  This trend was found in the phase I data, resulting in a summary equation in which CIELAB chroma differences contributed about half as much as hue and lightness differences to the total color difference. $ ^{8} $

<div style="text-align: center;">FIG. 14. Tolerance vectors, magnified 5 times, plotted on various CIELAB projections. Fig. 14(a) is a top view; the remaining projections are defined as shown in the top right-hand drawing.</div>


The blue tolerance vectors along the  $ -b^{*} $  axis did not orient toward the origin but slightly towards the  $ -a^{*} $  axis. This result was also observed by Luo and Rigg and was incorporated in the  $ BFD(\ell:c) $  equation by use of a covariance term that involves CIELAB chroma and hue. $ ^{2} $  This hue anomaly in the blue region of CIELAB can also be observed by plotting stimuli of constant Munsell hue on an  $ a^{*}b^{*} $  diagram. $ ^{36} $  Munsell 5PB has a definite curvature towards the  $ -a^{*} $  axis.

After examining the remaining projections, it is evident that the tolerances about the medium-gray color center were smallest, with an average difference of 1.02, identical in magnitude to the anchor pair. This color center was also closest in color space to the anchor pair; the color center had a nominal  $ L^{*} $  of 60, whereas the anchor pair had a nominal  $ L^{*} $  of 50. It was expected that this color center should have tolerances equivalent to the anchor pair. This close agreement is another indicator of the precision and accuracy of our group of observers in scaling color tolerances. The other two achromatic color centers, black and light gray, had average tolerances of 1.07 and 1.33, respectively. T tests were performed to determine whether the black and light gray color centers were significantly different from the medium-gray color center. The medium gray vectors D and E were excluded from the analysis because they were not measured in the other two color centers. The black was not statistically different from the medium gray (p = 0.149), whereas the light gray was statistically different (p = 0.003) with an  $ \alpha $  of 0.05. In lieu of the precision and accuracy of the Munsell value scale $ ^{37} $  and renotation experiments, $ ^{38} $  upon which  $ L^{*} $  is based, and our own precision and accuracy, this difference is likely a result of systematic differences in experimental design between the two visual experiments. In the value scale experiments, mat color-difference pairs each of  $ 1.2 \times 1.2 $  cm $ ^{2} $  were separated by 0.4 cm and viewed against a background of approximately Munsell value 5. In the renotation experiments, mat color-difference pairs each of  $ 1.2 \times 1.6 $  cm $ ^{2} $  were separated by 0.3 cm and also viewed against a background of approximately Munsell value 5. In our experiments, glossy color-difference pairs each of  $ 5.0 \times 6.5 $  cm $ ^{2} $  were positioned adjacent to one another and viewed against a background of approximately Munsell value 4. Differences in sample size, sample separation, gloss, and background lightness all affect color-difference judgments. $ ^{3} $  A CIE technical committee, TC1-28 Parameters Affecting Colour Difference Evaluation, is currently drafting a technical report summarizing current knowledge and will also provide a platform for further experimental research. We should recall that our anchor pair was one tenth in color difference compared to a step in Munsell value. Because the color-difference magnitudes were so much smaller, it is possible that our lack of agreement with the Munsell value scale is also a result of the non-Euclidean nature of color-difference judgments. Discrimination judgments at suprathreshold levels may not be equivalent to large color-difference judgment levels.

Similar to Fig. 14(a), Figs. 14(b)–14(e) indicate that the tolerance vectors that correspond to both CIELAB hue and chroma increase in magnitude as CIELAB chroma increases. This increase appears to depend, to some extent, on the particular region in color space. The figures also show that the CIELAB lightness tolerances for all the color centers depend, to a small extent, on their lightness position in CIELAB space. The trend is similar to that described for the three neutral color centers. Because of this kind of lightness position dependency, the CMC equation contains a lightness weight  $ S_{L} $ , whereas the BFD equation includes a new lightness equation optimized to color tolerance data rather than the Munsell value scale. However, the lightness weightings for CMC relative to  $ L^{*} $  is different than a weighting required to improve the uniformity of our data. Differences in weighting functions are a consequence of differences in viewing conditions and sample properties. These parametric differences between the various data sets should account for any systematic differences. Unfortunately, there may be insufficient information about the viewing conditions of the visual judgments leading to the CMC equation to facilitate a quantitative comparison.

The experimental design included vector directions F, G, H, and I to determine whether covariance existed between the dimensions of chromaticness and lightness. This is analogous to an ellipsoid that has a tilt when projections like Figs. 14(b)–(e) are viewed. For the most part, it appears that covariance is minimal, with the possible exception of the brilliant-greenish-blue color center  $ (L^{*} = 60, a^{*} = -13, b^{*} = -26) $ . In some projections, it appears to "tilt;" in other projections the apparent "tilt" in a consequence of vectors B and C having appreciable  $ \Delta L^{*} $  eigenvector values.

## Preliminary Equation Modeling

The primary objective of this research has been to develop a color-tolerance data set for use in improving the relationship between visual and numerical color-difference evaluation for industrial colorimetry. One way to fulfill this objective is to use this data set to test the accuracy of current color-difference equations. Methodology was developed previously $ ^{8} $  to perform the necessary analyses in a statistically meaningful way. In addition, this objective can be accomplished by developing new color-difference equations. At the current stage of this research program, equation development is of great interest. First, we desire to summarize mathematically the trends evident in Fig. 14. Second, publishing the mathematical summary would provide an example of how this data set can be used to develop color-tolerance equations.

As described previously, the 156 visual tolerances can be used to calculate 312 perceptually equivalent color tolerances. Each of the 312 tolerances has a set of corresponding "standard" (each vector's color center) and "trial" CIELAB coordinates. Each pair of coordinates can be transformed to any color space of interest for further computations. The present preliminary analysis was limited to CIELAB. The CIELAB values were used to calculate  $ \Delta L^{*} $ ,  $ \Delta a^{*} $ ,  $ \Delta b^{*} $ ,  $ \Delta C_{ab}^{*} $ , and  $ \Delta H_{ab}^{*} $  quantities. The  $ L^{*}, a^{*}, b^{*} $  and  $ C_{ab}^{*} $  values

of the color center and the delta values were used as predictor (independent) variables. The response (dependent) variable was the visual tolerance ( $ \Delta V $ ), equal to unity for the entire data set. Each tolerance also has a precision estimate, quantified by its fiducial limits, and an associated weight calculated via Eq. 1. These weights could be used in any model-building to incorporate the data set precision.

We tested some color-difference equations  $ (\Delta E) $  that simply weighted CIELAB difference components such as  $ \Delta L^{*} $ ,  $ \Delta a^{*} $ ,  $ \Delta b^{*} $ , or  $ \Delta L^{*} $ ,  $ \Delta C_{ab}^{*} $ ,  $ \Delta H_{ab}^{*} $ . We tested other equations similar to that of McDonald, $ ^{34} $  in essence a linear rather than the hyperbolic CMC equation. They were of the general form:

 $$ \begin{array}{r l}&{\Delta V=\Delta E=\bigg[\bigg(\frac{\Delta L^{*}}{\beta_{0,L}+\beta_{1,L}L_{\mathrm{S T D}}^{*}}\bigg)^{2}}\\ &{\quad+\bigg(\frac{\Delta C_{a b}^{*}}{\beta_{0,C}+\beta_{1,C}C_{a b,\mathrm{S T D}}^{*}}\bigg)^{2}}\\ &{\quad+\bigg(\frac{\Delta H_{a b}^{*}}{\beta_{0,H}+\beta_{1,H}C_{a b,\mathrm{S T D}}^{*}}\bigg)^{2}\bigg]^{0.5}.}\end{array} $$ 

The various  $ \beta $  coefficients are determined in the optimization. The statistical software package Systat $ ^{24} $  again was used to perform the weighted nonlinear optimizations. Those tolerances that had smaller normalized fiducial limits had a greater influence on determining the  $ \beta $  coefficients. Tolerances for which we found no fiducial limits were not used in the optimizations but would still be used in determining model effectiveness.

After a number of iterations, Eq. 3 was found to account for the most prominent, systematic departures:

 $$ \begin{array}{r l}&{\Delta V=\Delta E}\\ &{=\left[\left(\displaystyle\frac{\Delta L^{*}}{1}\right)^{2}+\left(\displaystyle\frac{\Delta C_{a b}^{*}}{1+0.048C_{a b,\mathrm{S T D}}^{*}}\right)^{2}\right.}\\ &{\quad+\left.\left(\displaystyle\frac{\Delta H_{a b}^{*}}{1+0.014C_{a b,\mathrm{S T D}}^{*}}\right)^{2}\right]^{0.5}.}\end{array} $$ 

Optimized equations weighting  $ L^{*} $  had  $ \beta_{0,L} $  and  $ \beta_{1,L} $  coefficients that were nearly 1 and 0, respectively. The lightness dependency noted above apparently is not well fit by a linear model. At the time of the writing of this article, we have insufficient data analyses to hypothesize the correct model. Consequently, the lightness tolerance was not weighted. The chroma and hue tolerances depend on the position of the color center relative to the achromatic axis. The chroma tolerance  $ \Delta C^{*} $  increased at about a four times greater rate with increasing chroma than the CIELAB hue tolerance,  $ \Delta H^{*} $ . The T50 values, and thus the CIELAB  $ \Delta F_{ab}^{*} $  values, had an average value of 1.44 for the 156 tolerances with a standard deviation of 0.51, as listed in Table IV. The values ranged from 0.78 to 4.4. The  $ \Delta E $  value computed from Eq. 3 had an average of 1.01, a standard deviation of 0.21, and a range of values from 0.57 to 1.77. These statistics exemplify the improvement in mathematically estimating the visual tolerances compared with CIELAB.

## CONCLUSIONS

A data set of 156 visual color tolerances perceptually equivalent to a near-gray anchor pair of 1 CIELAB color-difference unit has been generated. During the development of the experimental design, visual experiments, and data analysis, the goal has been to obtain a data set that has high precision and accuracy and that samples comprehensively the gamut of real surface colors. The accuracy of the population-tolerance estimates is confirmed by the agreement of these results with previous judgments of visual tolerances for five color centers suggested by the CIE for studies of color differences. The tolerance estimates have an average uncertainty of  $ \pm11\% $  at a 95% confidence (2σ level). This uncertainty level compares very well with experiments sampling similar regions of surface color space. Typical levels of uncertainty are  $ \pm20\% $  at the same confidence limits. Our uncertainties are significantly smaller than the systematic variations of tolerance magnitude observed with location and direction of difference in CIELAB space. The data set provides precise, accurate and well sampled information for the estimation of color-difference metric parameters or testing the performance of color-difference metrics.

Finally, this data set is available in electronic form from the primary author.
