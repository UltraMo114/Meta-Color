Received 1 June 2017; Revised 2 October 2017; Accepted 5 October 2017

Two separate but similar experiments were carried out at Leeds University (UK) and Zhejiang University (China), respectively. Both experiments were conducted to assess colour differences using Eizo displays using the ratio method. Eleven of the MacAdam centres within the colour gamut of the display were studied. Each centre included 21 samples assessed against a grey and a black background. The reason for using these different backgrounds was to simulate viewing a surface colour (surface mode) and a light source in the dark (illuminant mode), respectively. The results revealed that there were parametric effects for different backgrounds and luminances. The data were better fitted by CIELAB and CIELUV for the illuminant mode while CAM02-UCS performed best for the surface mode. The patterns of the ellipses between the data collected in these experiments and the original MacAdam data, show systematic discrepancies.

### 1. Introduction

The MacAdam ellipses, $ ^{1} $  shown in Figure 1, are well known in colour science. They are one of the first sets of psychophysical data quantifying threshold colour difference, and have been used to test the uniformity of a colour space. Figure 1 provides the first evidence to show the poor uniformity of the CIE (1931) x y chromaticity diagram. As it can be clearly seen, there is an obvious difference between the largest green (top) and the smallest blue (bottom left) areas. They differ by a factor of about ten in size.

These data were accumulated by MacAdam in 1942 using a self-luminous visual colorimeter $ ^{1,2} $  to perform a colour matching experiment. Twenty-five target colour centres were made by layers of different colour films and illuminated by a single light source, an illuminant C simulator. The viewing field consisted of a  $ 2^{\circ} $  circle against a  $ 42^{\circ} $  uniform background. The circle was separated into target and matching fields by a biprism, which were viewed monocularly. Colour matching was conducted along different lines/directions on the CIE (1931) x y chromaticity diagram originating from the colour centre. The data analysis was based on the standard deviations of the colour matching assessments. The size of each ellipse corresponds to one standard deviation, or just noticeable difference (JND). However, there are some drawbacks in the data. First,

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl//4cac0c03-bc38-44a1-8910-e5bbb6a440da/markdown_2/imgs/img_in_chart_box_120_142_499_521.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2025-12-30T04%3A23%3A11Z%2F-1%2F%2Fa7b0e913293a3d194ec7f16329ad218147a93eeee84cd3fdade77831fc0b9ab9" alt="Image" width="35%" /></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Figure 1 MacAdam discrimination ellipses plotted in 10 JND steps. Those marked with a cross are the colour centres in the present study. The two triangles represent the display gamuts for the ZJU and Leeds displays</div>


the data were based only on a single observer and all stimuli were at one luminance. Moreover, some drawbacks of the monocular colour matching method, such as incomplete adaptation, unnatural viewing, are well known.

Despite this, MacAdam ellipses have been used by the lighting industry as a metric to evaluate the chromaticity of lighting products. Current standards for the specification of chromaticity, such as ANSI C78.376 for fluorescent lamps $ ^{3} $  and ANSI C78.377 for solid state lighting products, $ ^{4} $  are expressed in terms of about seven MacAdam JND units. However, these standards define chromaticity coordinates and correlated colour temperature (CCT) of white light stimuli, i.e. light sources whose chromaticities lie on the daylight and Plankian loci. $ ^{5} $  However, in the fast-evolving lighting industry, LED products may include a variety of hue colours, for which an evaluation method has not been specified.

In one of the authors' earlier studies, $ ^{6} $  an evaluation of colour difference metrics for white light sources based on the specifications of the ANSI C78.377 standard was performed. The results were very promising regarding the use of the CIE u'v' chromaticity diagram for the evaluation of colour differences of lighting products. The results verify the recommendation of the CIE Technical Note $ ^{7} $  which uses the CIE u'v' chromaticity diagram to define an n-step JND of approximately  $ 0.0011 \times n $ . Moreover, one of the findings was that the MacAdam ellipses in close proximity to these data did not agree well. Therefore, in the current study, a set including white light stimuli from the ANSI C78.377 standard and coloured light stimuli from the MacAdam experiment were used to acquire a unique dataset of colour difference assessments of lighting stimuli.

The aim of the present study is to study the perception of colour differences, seen against different backgrounds and at different luminances. For the former, the stimuli are seen against grey and black backgrounds designed to simulate a lit surface and display lights, respectively. They can be considered examples of the surface and illuminant mode of appearance, respectively. These data can be used to compare different colour spaces. Finally, the ellipse patterns from the MacAdam and the present data are compared.

### 2. Experiment

### 2.1 EIZO display

The experiment was performed on two EIZO CG220 displays, one located in Leeds, UK and one in Zhejiang, China. Table 1 lists the definition of correlated colour temperature (CCT) and luminance (cd/m $ ^{2} $ ) for each display. As it can be seen, both are close to the internal target of 6500 K and 100 cd/m $ ^{2} $ .

Note that during the experiment, the experimenter measured the peak white after the display had warmed up for 30 min at the beginning of each working day to ensure that

the monitor white corresponded to a lumi-

nance of  $ 100 \, cd/m^{2} $ .

A JETI 1211 and a Konica-Minolta CS1000 tele-spectroradiometer (TSR) instrument were used at Zhejiang University (ZJU) and Leeds University, respectively. The systems had a repeatability of 0.21 (from 0.04 to 0.48) and 0.45 (from 0.05 to 0.68)  $ \Delta E^{*}_{ab} $  for the ZJU and Leeds data, respectively. These repeatability scores were obtained by repeatedly measuring the same 96 colours over a period of 1 hour. Note that all the CIELAB colour differences were calculated using the CIE D65/10 conditions.

### 2.2 Sample preparation

Eleven colour centres were selected from the MacAdam dataset, all of which were within the colour gamuts of the displays (see

<div style="text-align: center;">Table 1 The specification of the EIZO display at the two sites</div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl//4cac0c03-bc38-44a1-8910-e5bbb6a440da/markdown_3/imgs/img_in_chart_box_99_855_523_1206.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2025-12-30T04%3A23%3A12Z%2F-1%2F%2F8c220199c59c3e88d8eeebb56e535061c6223bc40bc6185ab696a47e0395d936" alt="Image" width="39%" /></div>


Figure 1) and five of them had two luminances, 48 and 18.5 cd/m². The former luminance was the original luminance used in the MacAdam experiment corresponding to an L* of 75, while the latter has an L* value of 50. In addition, eight neutral centres from the ANSI C78.377 standard were included. Also, two colour centres in the blue and green areas close to the gamut boundary were added to cover these areas. Finally, two centres were repeated to examine the repeatability performance. Overall, 28 colour centres were studied.

For each colour centre, 21 pairs of chromatic differences were prepared. The colour centre was always included in each pair. The 21 points were chosen to cover a semi-circle surrounding the colour centre ranging from  $ 0^{\circ} $  to  $ 180^{\circ} $ . The difference between each colour centre and each sample in the ellipse was defined by means of a constant chromatic distance in the colour space in question, i.e. CIE  $ u^{\prime}v^{\prime} $  and CIELAB  $ a^{*}b^{*} $  planes for the Leeds and ZJU studies, respectively. Figure 2 shows the targets for a colour centre used at (a) ZJU and (b) Leeds, corresponding to  $ 5\Delta E^{*}_{ab} $  and  $ 0.007u^{\prime}v^{\prime} $  units, respectively.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl//4cac0c03-bc38-44a1-8910-e5bbb6a440da/markdown_3/imgs/img_in_chart_box_524_853_970_1207.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2025-12-30T04%3A23%3A12Z%2F-1%2F%2F319b6893707921662888a7634ad8f98086fe6c7f0db47127aaa0b1f18c625834" alt="Image" width="41%" /></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Figure 2 The samples investigated for a colour centre at (a) ZJU and (b) Leeds. (a) CIELAB a*b* plane and (b) CIE u'v' plane</div>


Note that the colour differences of  $ 5 \Delta E^{*}_{ab} $  and  $ 0.007 u'v' $  used here are much larger than those used in the MacAdam experiment which was aimed to find JNDs. The latter cannot be used here due to the limitation of the 8-bit display. Its typical repeatability was about  $ 0.6 \Delta E^{*}_{ab} $  units (see later). A ratio method was used for the visual assessment rather than MacAdam's threshold method (see later).

Two background colours were used, a grey and a black. They were used to simulate the surface and illuminant colours, respectively, and are called the surface and illuminant models, respectively. For the same reason, each stimulus was represented by circular patches of  $ 4^{\circ} $  approximately, so as to resemble light sources in their shape. The grey background was used to reproduce the same surround field used in the MacAdam experiment, i.e. a chromaticity of illuminant C and a luminance of  $ 24\,cd/m^{2} $ . Both Cui et al. $ ^{8,9} $  and Berns $ ^{10} $  have found that the grey background can effectively simulate the surface colour viewing condition on displays. Therefore, the data acquired from different types of stimuli arrangement can be compared.

Twenty normal colour vision observers took part at each site. They all passed the Ishihara vision test. There were 10/10 and 8/12 male/female observers for ZJU and Leeds, respectively. They had average age of 23 and 30 years old, respectively.

At each site, 23,520 assessments were made, i.e. 28 centres × 21 pairs × 2 backgrounds × 20 observers.

### 2.3 Colour model accuracy

Colour accuracy in the reproduction of the colour stimuli is essential in two experiments conducted at different sites. The aim is to reproduce the targets shown in Figure 2 for each colour centre. The reproduction is reported in terms of  $ \Delta EE $  (see equation (1))

<div style="text-align: center;">Table 2 Performance of display models to predict test colours</div>

in  $ \Delta E^{*}_{ab} $  units for all the pairs studied. The data of the delta analysis are given in Table 2.

 $$ \begin{aligned}\Delta EE_{i}=\sqrt{\{(\Delta L_{M,i}^{*}-\Delta L_{T,i}^{*})^{2}+(\Delta a_{M,i}^{*}-\Delta a_{T,i}^{*})^{2}}\\+(\Delta b_{M,i}^{*}-\Delta b_{T,i}^{*})^{2}\}\end{aligned} $$ 

where  $ \Delta L^{*}_{M,i} $ ,  $ \Delta L^{*}_{T,i} $ ,  $ \Delta a^{*}_{M,i} $ ,  $ \Delta a^{*}_{T,i} $ ,  $ \Delta b^{*}_{M,i} $ ,  $ \Delta b^{*}_{T,i} $  are the colour differences expressed in CIELAB L*, a*, b*. The subscripts, M and T, stand for the measured real samples and target, respectively. The  $ \Delta L^{*}_{M,i} $  and  $ \Delta L^{*}_{T,i} $  are the lightness differences calculated between the colour centre and each sample (see Figure 2).

Table 2 shows the mean  $ \Delta EE $  values to represent the typical reproduction error for all 1176 pairs. Overall, the error was about  $ 0.6 \Delta E^{*}_{ab} $  for both sites, which represents the colour accuracy of a typical 8 bit colour display.

### 2.4 Software and reference pair

Software was written using MATLAB to perform the visual assessment.

During each experiment, two pairs of stimuli were presented. The reference and testing pairs were presented in two rows. Note that their location within these rows was randomly interchanged in both dimensions in order to avoid any automatic replies and eye fatigue. The reference pair consisted of two fixed green colour stimuli close to one of the MacAdam's colour centres. These were set with a fixed chromaticity and a lightness difference  $ \Delta L^{*} $  of six units for both experiments. This magnitude was chosen to ensure

<div style="text-align: center;">Figure 3 Experimental stimuli arrangement for the black background (illuminant mode) (left) and for the grey background (surface mode) (right)</div>


that the colour difference was clear and remained constant through all phases. The experimental arrangement of the stimuli is illustrated in Figure 3. Observers were asked to assess the colour difference of each testing chromaticity pair against the standard reference pair which was assigned a colour difference of one visual unit. Using the ratio scaling method, $ ^{[11]} $  the observers evaluated whether the testing pair had a larger or smaller colour difference than that of the reference pair, and reported a value larger or smaller than one accordingly. A scroll bar was provided in the software interface so as to record each assessment.

### 3. Inter-observer variability

The inter- and intra-observer variability was first analysed. The standardised residual sum of squares (STRESS) is calculated using equation (2), and was used to indicate the variability between two sets of data $ ^{12} $ 

 $$ STRESS=100\sqrt{\frac{\sum\left(Y_{i}-fX_{i}\right)^{2}}{\sum Y_{i}^{2}}} $$ 

where  $ f=\frac{\sum Y_{i}X_{i}}{\sum Y_{i}^{2}} $  is a scaling factor and  $ X_{i} $  and  $ Y_{i} $  are the two sets of data for pair i.

The STRESS measure has been used widely in the colour-difference research field. $ ^{12-16} $  It is used throughout the data analysis in this study. For a perfect agreement, the STRESS value is zero. A value of 30 means a 30% disagreement.

For the inter-observer variability, the STRESS value was calculated between the mean and each individual's results. These were then averaged to indicate the overall performance. For the intra-observer variability, the results for the two colour centres that were assessed twice by the same observers in each site were used. The two repeats and the mean were used to calculate STRESS. Table 3 summarises the results for both inter- and intra-variability.

From the results, it can be concluded that:

- The intra-observer variability is about half that of the inter-observer variability.

• ZJU observers performed slightly more consistently than those of Leeds observers. However, the difference is small, i.e. mean of 26 and 29, and of 13 and 15 for the inter- and intra-observer variability, respectively.

- Observers performed slightly more consistently against the black background than against the grey background.

- The STRESS values are consistent with the results of other studies such as by Luo et al. $ ^{6} $

<div style="text-align: center;">Figure 4 The visual results plotted between the two repeated colour centres for (a) ZJU data and (b) Leeds data</div>


In addition, the visual results from the two repeated centres were also compared. Note that the mean of the ratio data for each observer was averaged to represent the panel results and are used in the subsequent analysis. The results are given in Figure 4 for the ZJU and Leeds data, separately. It can be seen that they have excellent agreement having a STRESS value of 8 for both sites. An ANOVA test was also conducted and the results showed that both sets of data had no significant difference between the two repeated assessments, i.e. p>0.05.

### 4. Comparing visual results due to parametric difference

Parametric effects are investigated in this section. There are three effects: (1) background effect (between grey and black background), (2) luminance effect (between high and low luminance for the same colour centre, and (3) colour space effect (between CIELAB vs. CIE u'v' spaces for sampling).

The methods used to compare two sets of data include to plot between two sets of visual difference ( $ \Delta V $ ), and between two sets of

chromatic ellipses of a centre. An ellipse is defined by equation (3). $ ^{1} $  For the latter, the chromatic colour-difference ellipse was fitted for each colour centre in a particular space. Equation (3) shows an equation for an ellipse in the CIELAB a*b* plane.

 $$ \Delta E^{2}=g_{11}\Delta a^{*2}+2g_{12}\Delta a^{*}\Delta b^{*}+g_{22}\Delta b^{*2} $$ 

where  $ \Delta a^{*} $  and  $ \Delta b^{*} $  are the difference between the colour centre and a sample. The three g coefficients were optimised by minimising the STRESS value between the  $ \Delta E $  and  $ \Delta V $  for each centre.

The ellipse equation can also be expressed by the ellipse parameters (equation (4)) in terms of semi-long (A), semi-short (B), and orientation ( $ \theta $ ).

 $$ A=\frac{1}{\sqrt{g_{22}+g_{12}\cot\theta}} $$ 

<div style="text-align: center;">(a)</div>


<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl//4cac0c03-bc38-44a1-8910-e5bbb6a440da/markdown_7/imgs/img_in_chart_box_107_764_536_1186.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2025-12-30T04%3A23%3A14Z%2F-1%2F%2Fdc0d4c1b5a9de125d817d3f1a7bb296249e90e30e25ce367248dcfe223ccc45a" alt="Image" width="40%" /></div>


 $$ B=\frac{1}{\sqrt{g_{11}-g_{12}\cot\theta}} $$ 

 $$ \theta=\frac{1}{2}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2g_{12}}{g_{11}-g_{22}}\right) $$ 

where g coefficients are the parameters obtained from equation (3). When comparing ellipses, ellipse size and shape were also used, which are calculated by the square root of  $ AB\pi $  and by A/B, respectively. For a circle, A equals B so that A/B equals one.

### 4.1 Background effect

The background effect was first investigated. As mentioned earlier, the black and grey backgrounds represent two modes of appearance, illuminant and surface modes. Figure 5 shows the visual results in terms of  $ \Delta V $  of grey background plotted against black background for ZJU data and Leeds data separately.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl//4cac0c03-bc38-44a1-8910-e5bbb6a440da/markdown_7/imgs/img_in_chart_box_540_760_968_1186.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2025-12-30T04%3A23%3A14Z%2F-1%2F%2F55a25ef029509a51e5185be8736c14c1a4280c9e96828fff30f90639040c748c" alt="Image" width="39%" /></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Figure 5 The visual results of the black plotted against grey background for (a) the ZJU data and (b) the Leeds data</div>


The results showed that colour differences against a black background were larger than those against by the grey background, i.e. all the points are located above the  $ 45^{\circ} $  line. They had slopes of 1.16 and 1.30 for the ZJU and Leeds data, respectively. They had correlation coefficient (r) values of 0.55 and 0.96 and STRESS values of 15 and 16 for ZJU and Leeds data, respectively. ANOVA results showed a significant background effect for both datasets.

The ellipses in the  $ a^{*}b^{*} $  plane were also compared by plotting those of black and grey backgrounds. The ellipses from the ZJU and Leeds data for different luminances are plotted in Figure 6. For both datasets in Figure 6,

the ellipses at both luminances agreed with each other very well for the shapes and orientation except that the black background ellipses are consistently smaller than the grey background ellipses.

### 4.2 Luminance effect

The second investigation is on the effect of luminance of sample pairs. Figure 7 shows the visual results in terms of  $ \Delta V $  of high luminance level (48 cd/m $ ^{2} $ ) plotted against those of low luminance (18.5 cd/m $ ^{2} $ ) for ZJU data and Leeds data, separately.

The results showed that there are some differences between the ZJU and Leeds data, i.e. colour differences at a high luminance appeared larger than those of the low luminance for the ZJU data by 20%, but there is not much difference for the Leeds dataset. They had a slope of 0.85 and 1.05 for ZJU and Leeds Universities, respectively. They had r values of 0.25 and 0.48 and STRESS values of 18 and 16 for ZJU and Leeds Universities, respectively. ANOVA results showed a significant background effect for both datasets.

The ellipses in a*b* plane were also compared between the two luminances for the ZJU and Leeds data, separately. Figures 8 and 9 plot the experimental ellipses for the ZJU and Leeds datasets, respectively. In each figure, both black and grey background ellipses are plotted. Also, the ellipses of the high and low luminance levels are plotted in magenta and black colours, respectively. It can be seen in both figures that the ellipses at both luminances agreed with each other very well except that the higher luminance (48 cd/m²) ellipses are slightly larger than the lower luminance (18.5 cd/m²) ellipses. The Leeds data in Figure 9 also give a very similar trend, i.e. the 48 cd/m² ellipses are slightly larger than the 18.5 cd/m² ellipses.

each ellipse. They all had a luminance of  $ 48 \, cd/m^{2} $  and were assessed under illuminant C.

Five colour models were tested. They formed three categories. First, the two CIE-recommended colour spaces $ ^{17,18} $  CIELAB and CIELUV were used to sample the ZJU and Leeds data. Although, CIE u'v' diagram was used to prepare the samples,

CIELUV gives the same performance as  $ u^{\prime}v^{\prime} $  for chromatic differences. Second, CIECAM02 $ ^{19} $  is the CIE-recommended colour appearance model and CAM02-UCS $ ^{20} $  is an extension of CIECAM02 and gives an accurate prediction of all the available medium size colour-difference datasets. Finally, the FMC-I equation $ ^{21} $  developed by Chickering et al. in 1967 was also tested because the equation was developed to fit the original MacAdam data. (Note the testing results for FMC-I also represent the difference between the MacAdam and present datasets.)

Four datasets were used to test above models, ZJU, Leeds, combined datasets and MacAdam. Note: The latter was obtained by extracting the data points from each MacAdam ellipse. The combined data included both the ZJU and Leeds datasets.

The results can be summarised below:

1) In general, for the black background data (illuminant mode), the models showed differences between the ZJU and Leeds datasets. For the former, CIELAB and CIECAM02 performed better than the other models. For the latter, CIELUV performed better than the other models. This seems to be related to the space used for sampling.

2) For the grey background data (surface mode), the CAM02-UCS model performed the best for both datasets. This confirms the earlier findings that self-luminous colours displayed on a grey background can simulate surface colours well. $ ^{20} $  CAM02-UCS is well known to fit the surface colour data well.

3) For the combined data, CAM02-UCS again consistently performed the best as expected for the grey background data. For the black background data, CIECAM02 performed the best, followed by CIELAB and CIELUV. They all made more accurate predictions than the other models.

4) FMC-I is the model derived to fit the MacAdam data. It can be seen that it predicts the MacAdam data best but performed poorly for all the other datasets. This implies that the MacAdam data have very different characteristics than the other datasets.

### 6. Comparing the ellipses from three sets of data

Figure 10 shows the three sets of ellipses adjusted to equal size (one scaling factor for each set). A clear pattern can be seen from the MacAdam ellipses in red, i.e. the size of all ellipses are increased from the smallest blue to the largest green in a radial shape. Comparing the two sets of the present data, they are similar except for the four ellipses in the bottom (from blue, purplish red, reddish purple and red) and the one in the green-yellow (top right). However, both of the present sets had large disagreements with the MacAdam set.

### 7. Conclusions

Two sets of colour difference studies were carried out at Zhejiang and Leeds Universities. The resulting data were produced in a way close to that of the MacAdam data in terms of the luminance and chromaticity of colour centres and background colours. Each dataset included different parameters such as grey and black backgrounds, high and low luminance pairs. The results showed some visual effects, i.e. there is a clear background effect, no clear difference in luminance of sample pairs, but some differences in the colour spaces used for sampling.

The results were used to test different colour models. It was found that CAM02-UCS developed to fit surface colour data gave the best performance for the grey background results, which is well known to simulate display colours as surface colours as confirmed by Cui et al. $ ^{8,9} $  For the black background colours, CIELAB and CIELUV performed the best for the ZJU and Leeds datasets, respectively. Overall, the MacAdam data stand out on its own.
