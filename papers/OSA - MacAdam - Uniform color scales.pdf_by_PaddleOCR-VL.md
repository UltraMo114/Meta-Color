Judgments of relative magnitudes of color differences exhibited by 128 selected nearest-neighbor pairs of 59 colored tiles were recorded by 49 to 76 observers, all of whom had normal color vision. Scale values that represent the perceived magnitudes of the color differences were obtained by statistical analysis of their reports. From colorimetric specifications of the tiles, formulas have been devised that define a three-dimensional euclidean space in which the distances between the points that represent the colors correlate reasonably well with the reported magnitudes of the perceived color differences. Lattice points of a regular rhombohedral crystal in that space have been used to specify about 500 colors that are being made for distribution by the Optical Society. Because of the manner of selection of those colors, each except the most saturated of the chosen colors will exhibit equal magnitudes of color difference from 12 others. About 2500 equally noticeable color differences can be exhibited by suitable arrangements of those colors. Each except the most saturated of the colors can be arranged in six different series. Each of those series exhibits from three to ten color differences, all of equal magnitude. Such a series of colors, which exhibits equal color differences is known as a uniform color scale. Provision of a set of colors with which the maximum possible number and variety of uniform color scales can be constructed was the goal of the Optical Society Committee on Uniform Color Scales, of which this is a report.

The report $ ^{1} $  of the Committee on Colorimetry of the Optical Society of America said "Color differences consisting solely of chromaticity differences without luminance differences are rare; there is no known way of evaluating the noticeability of combined luminance and chromaticity differences. The experimental clarification of this problem is one of the major programs yet to be completed in the field of colorimetric research." As reported by Judd, $ ^{2,3} $  the Committee on Uniform Color Scales was formed by the Optical Society to stimulate and coordinate research on that subject. Judd's reports $ ^{2,3} $  list several dozen papers that have been published by members of the committee, and by others who have contributed to the study, on various facets of the subject. The committee expects and encourages further publication based on details of its work, and on further developments made possible by it.

In his 1955 progress report, $ ^{2} $  Dr. Judd wrote, “We have progressed in our laboratory studies to the point where we need to prepare a set of about 500 color chips equally spaced according to the laboratory results, to be studied by the committee as a closing check before preparation of a final report.” He explained further that “the ultimate proof that the problem of producing uniform color scales has been solved is, of course, the actual production of chips exemplifying such uniform spacing, for any skeptic to look at.” The intention of the committee was to make colors that correspond to about 500 lattice points of a regular-rhombohedral crystal in a euclidean color space in which equal distances between points correspond to equal visual differences between the corresponding colors. Such colors could be arranged in the greatest number of interlocking series (scales) of visually equally different colors. Every color would have 12 equally different nearest neighbors and would appear in six entirely different series (scales) of equally different colors.

Because of the great cost of making such colors, and because the committee could not agree on the definition of a euclidean color space in which they were all confident that equal distances correspond to visually equal color differences, the plan came to naught. Instead, the committee decided to study a limited sample, consisting of 43 colors (made in the form of 5-cm-hexagonal, matte-finish, painted ceramic tiles, all having approximately the same luminous reflectance (30%) in CIE Standard  $ D_{65} $  daylight, and having chromaticities indicated to be equally different and triangularly arranged in a color space derived, tentatively, by modifying the Munsell renotations $ ^{4} $  in ways indicated by ellipses of standard deviations of color matching. $ ^{5} $ 

## PROCEDURE

Five sets of those tiles were made and circulated among members of the committee, each of whom compared pairs of the tiles and recorded his estimates of the relative visual color differences, according to an experimental plan suggested by experts in the U. S. National Bureau of Standards. The tiles were surrounded and separated 3–4 mm from each other by a 30% reflectance gray card. The tiles and surround were illuminated with daylight of at least 500 lm/m².

Each committee member also enlisted as many as he could of his colleagues who had normal color vision, to make and record additional sets of judgments. Altogether, 76 observers made sets of judgments. The observers were divided, at random, into four groups, each of which made a different set of judgments, to distribute the load of the enormous number of possible

pair comparisons that are involved when even only the nearest neighbors of the triangularly arranged set of 43 samples are used. There were 104 such pairs. The subdivision of the test, with an adequate number and distribution of pair comparisons that were made by all observers, to inter-relate the results of the four groups, was part of the experimental plan. The judgment data were analyzed by use of appropriate psychometric techniques, at the NBS.

Sixteen additional tiles that did not have equal luminous reflectances were prepared and similarly judged by 49 observers. Those tiles consisted of four sets of four tiles each. Each set formed a regular tetrahedron in the tentative color space. One group was light  $ (Y=80) $  yellow; the second group was dark  $ (Y=6.6) $  blue; the third was a medium dark  $ (Y=10) $  red; and the fourth was a medium light  $ (Y=30) $  green. The color difference between one pair of colors taken from a single group was compared with the difference between another pair, taken from the same or from a different group. When both pairs were from the same group, one color could be common to both pairs, e.g., the pair A,B could be compared with the pair A,C. Not all such possible pairs were judged, but a sufficient number, according to a suitable experimental design, so that all of those color differences could be evaluated on a single scale.

Because the equal-reflectance and unequal-reflectance sets of tiles were judged separately, several years apart, by different observers, the units of the scale values determined for the two sets were different. The same illumination, background, and separation of tiles were used as for the constant-Y pairs.

## RESULTS

After study by the committee and adjustment of the unit of the scale values for the tetrahedral-selection judgments, relative to that for the triangular-selection (constant-Y) judgments, evaluations of the 128 perceived color differences between the 59 color tiles were agreed upon by the members of the committee. Those evaluations are given in Table I.

Spectrophotometric data for each tile were determined several times. They were measured both before and after the tiles were circulated to the committee. Their spectral reflectances were measured in several laboratories. Slight yellowing was detected, which had occurred over the period of nearly a year between the first and last measurements, during which most of the tiles were being circulated and judged. Slight differences of the values measured by the different laboratories were traced to slight differences of geometry of illumination and collection of light reflected from the matte tiles. The intention of the committee was to illuminate perpendicularly and to collect all of the reflected light, but different instruments approximate these conditions slightly differently.

The CIE specifications for  $ D_{65} $  and for the 1964 supplementary observer for  $ 10^{\circ} $  visual field, based on the agreed-upon spectral reflectance data, are given in Table II. Note that values of luminous reflectance, Y, for the first 43, nominally equally light tiles, are not all quite equal.

The chromaticities of the 43 purportedly equally light tiles are indicated by the numbered points in Fig. 1. The sums of the lengths of the arrows drawn between pairs of nearest neighbors of those points represent, on the scale shown in Fig. 1, the perceived color differences (“scale values” in the committee’s terminology). In the appropriate cases, the lengths of superimposed rectangles should be added to the distance between the points representing the colors.

The chromaticities of the tiles that form tetrahedra in color space are shown by the points in Fig. 2. The luminous reflectance, Y, is written close to each point. Because all four possible pairs of colors from each tetrahedron were used in the judgments and because the third (Y) dimension cannot be portrayed satisfactorily on the flat page, lines have not been drawn to represent the subjective scale values for the color differences represented in Fig. 2. Points that represent pairs of colors of nearly equal luminous reflectance (Y) are merely joined to facilitate visualization of their arrangements.

## FORMULAS FOR COLOR DIFFERENCE

Several members of the committee attempted to modify various proposed formulas for evaluating visual color differences, so as to account for the "scale values" that were obtained from the judgments. Dr. Judd and Miss Nickerson tried various modifications of the Munsell Renotation Formula. $ ^{4} $  Judd and Howett tried the 1964 CIE U*, V*, W* formula. $ ^{6} $  Reilly tried the cube-root formula, $ ^{6} $  and MacAdam tried the modified Friele formula. $ ^{6} $  Because the modified Friele formula implied a noneuclidean color space, in which a regular-rhombohedral selection of colors would not be possible, MacAdam devised a three-dimensional color space, based on a nonlinear (geodesic) transformation of the CIE 1931 x,y chromaticity diagram. $ ^{7} $ 

Because it seemed to fit the scale values most closely, and at the request of Dr. Judd, MacAdam used an iterative computer program to compute CIE  $ (x,y,Y) $  specifications for about 500 colors at the lattice points of a regular-rhombohedral array in that color space. MacAdam used those specifications in a computer-controlled scanner to prepare color-photographic approximations to 400 of those colors. $ ^{8} $  MacAdam's formulas were not, however, suitable for extrapolation much beyond the gamut of chromaticities of the 59 colors that the committee used to obtain the judgment data.

Because a majority of the committee desired to extrapolate the results out to the theoretical limits, $ ^{9} $  the committee decided to use instead a formula based on the cube-root formula suggested for tests by the CIE Committee on Colorimetry. $ ^{6} $  When the parameters of that formula, and a few others that were suggested by Reilly, were adjusted for best fit to the committee's scale values for the observed color differences, a correlation with the committee's "scale values" not significantly lower than MacAdam's was obtained.

The third dimension of the cube-root formula was modified, at Dr. Judd's request, to take into account the effects of the 30% reflectance, gray background in making differences of lightness of about that level more noticeable than differences between much lighter samples or between much darker samples. Semmelroth's formula, which resulted from his study of this effect, $ ^{10} $  was used as the basis for that adjustment. The constants of Semmelroth's formula were adjusted to give the best fit to the scale values of all of the color differences. Greatest weight was given to fitting the scale values for pairs of the tetrahedrally arranged colors, many of which involved predominant differences of lightness.

The third dimension was also modified by use of a formula published by Sanders and Wyszecki, $ ^{[11]} $  based on their study of the effects of chromaticity on lightness. In general, colors of high colorimetric purity appear lighter than grays that have exactly the same value of luminous reflectance, Y. This effect cannot be eliminated, or corrected, or allowed for, by any possible change of the luminosity curve,  $ \tilde{y} $ , or by any change of the other color-mixture curves  $ \tilde{x} $  or  $ \tilde{z} $ . The formula that specifies the luminous reflectance of the equally light gray, reported for the 1957 judgments of Sanders (see Ref. 11) was used, with only a minor adjustment of one constant to make the formula consistent with the committee's decision to base its color space on  $ D_{65} $  rather than CIE illuminant C.

The three coordinates of the committee’s final color space are £, j, g, lightness, yellowness, and greenness, respectively. The initial j (from the French word jaune, for yellow) is used to avoid confusion with the CIE chromaticity coordinate, y.

The modified Semmelroth $ ^{10} $  formula

 $$ \mathcal{L}=5.9\left[Y_{0}^{\ddag}-\frac{2}{3}+0.042(Y_{0}-30)^{\ddag}\right] $$ 

is used. The value of  $ Y_{0} $  is given by the modified CLS (1957) formula $ ^{11} $ 

 $$ \begin{aligned}Y_{0}=Y\left(4.4934x^{2}+4.3034y^{2}-4.276xy-1.3744x\right.\\ \left.-2.5643y+1.8103\right).\end{aligned} $$ 

The values of luminous reflectance Y of various colors that are as light as a 30% reflectance gray according to Eq. (2) are shown in Fig. 3. To match the lightness of any other gray, the required values of Y are in proportion to the luminous reflectance  $ Y_{0} $  of the gray. The values of Y, x, and y were based on  $ D_{65} $  illumination and the CIE 1964 supplementary observer data, and on the basis of  $ Y_{0}=100 $  for a perfectly diffuse, perfect reflector (white).

The chromaticness coordinates are defined by

 $$ g{=}C{(-13.7R^{\frac{1}{3}}{+}17.7G^{\frac{1}{3}}{-}4B^{\frac{1}{3}})}{=}C a, $$ 

 $$ j=C(1.7R^{\frac{1}{3}}+8G^{\frac{1}{3}}-9.7B^{\frac{1}{3}})=C b, $$ 

where

 $$ \begin{array}{r l}&{C=\mathcal{L}/\left[5.9(Y_{0}^{\frac{1}{3}}-\frac{2}{3})\right]}\\ &{\quad=1+0.042(Y_{0}-30)^{\frac{1}{3}}/(Y_{0}^{\frac{1}{3}}-\frac{2}{3}),}\end{array} $$ 

 $$ R=0.799X+0.4194Y-0.1648Z, $$ 

 $$ G=-0.4493X+1.3265Y+0.0927Z, $$ 

and

 $$ B=\bar{-}0.1149X+0.3394Y+0.717Z. $$ 

The factor C applies Semmelroth's crispening to color differences, depending on the closeness of their lightnesses to that of the 30% reflectance gray surround. The quantities in parentheses in the expressions for g and j are sometimes designated a and b, respectively, as indicated in the second parts of Eqs. (3a) and (3b).

The indicated transformations, Eqs. (4), from CIE tristimulus values X, Y, Z (for  $ D_{65} $  and the 1964 supplementary observer) to R, G, B were derived by Reilly, as were the forms of the expressions (a and b) in the parentheses for the formulas for g and j. The formulas for R, G, and B imply the use of mixture colors (primaries) at

 $$ \begin{aligned}&x_{R}=0.747,\quad&y_{R}=0.253\\&x_{G}=2.92,\quad&y_{G}=-4.54.\\&x_{B}=0.171,\quad&y_{B}=0.\end{aligned} $$ 

Note that when, as is often the case, the available data are in the form x, y, Y, the other tristimulus values can be obtained from X=xY/y and  $ Z=(1-x-y)Y/y $ .

Formulas (1)–(4) should not be used to construct a formula for evaluation of small color differences or tolerances, because the color differences judged by the committee were all more than 20 times just noticeable. MacAdam $ ^{12} $  pointed out that multiplication of differences of chromaticity from gray by a function of V, such

as in the definitions $ ^{6} $  of  $ U^{*} $  and  $ V^{*} $ , and as is implicit in Eqs. (3a) and (3b), assumes that the ellipsoids of equal noticeability are significantly tipped in CIE x,y,Y space. MacAdam $ ^{12} $  and Schultz and Gall $ ^{13} $  showed that such tipping is not appropriate for small color differences or tolerances. Therefore, Eqs. (1) through (4) should not be used to evaluate small color differences.

Strictly interpreted, Eqs. (1)–(4) should not be used for evaluating large color differences, either, because they are based on only the committee's judgments of the tiles, as described. The committee does not claim broader validity for them. Furthermore, Eqs. (1)–(4) were limited to a euclidean form so that they could be used to derive a regular-rhombohedral selection of colors. The scale values in Table I indicate that a noneuclidean formula is necessary for most-accurate evaluation of large color differences. The data in Tables I and II or similar data for more observers, obtained under even better conditions, if possible, would be suitable for derivation of such noneuclidean formulas.

## COMMITTEE COLOR SPACE

The coordinates g and j are zero for grays. Positive values of j, with nearly zero values of g, indicate yellowish or brownish colors. Negative values of j, with nearly zero values of g, indicate blues. Positive values of g, with nearly zero values of j, indicate greens. Negative values of g, with nearly zero values of j, indicate magenta.

The values of g and j can be computed for spectrum colors. However, because for any wavelength the values depend on Y, a specific value of Y must be assumed at each wavelength, in order to define the spectrum locus. Nimeroff $ ^{14} $  discussed the analogous case for the CIE  $ U^{*} $ ,  $ V^{*} $ ,  $ W^{*} $  coordinate system. The most-familiar general shape, and the spectrum locus most appropriate for inclusion on diagrams of chromaticities of samples that have equal luminous reflectance, results from assignment of the same value of Y to each wavelength of the spectrum as for the reflecting samples. In principle, that assumption is impermissible, because materials that reflect only a single wavelength (or any sufficiently narrow wavelength band to be represented by a point on a spectrum locus, except for dominant wavelengths longer than about 570 nm) have extremely low luminous reflectances. For such values of Y, the spectrum locus would collapse on the negative  $ \delta $  axis (black). However, admitting that the procedure is inconsistent, we show in Fig. 4 three spectral loci (with their origins displaced, so as to avoid overlap) based on the assumptions that Y=15, Y=30, and Y=73. Note that the locus of additive mixtures of violet (360 nm) and red (700 nm), which is straight in the CIE x,y diagram, is distinctly curved outwards in Fig. 4 and that the wavelengths 360 to 430 nm, which are crowded very close together in the CIE x,y and u,v diagrams, are spread rather widely in Fig. 5.

## REPRESENTATION OF JUDGMENT RESULTS IN COMMITTEE COLOR SPACE

The points that represent the 43 equal-luminous-reflectance colors that the committee used for its color-difference judgments are shown in Fig. 5. The scale values that represent the relative amounts of color difference perceived between the various pairs of nearest neighbors of those colors are represented by the sums of the lengths of the arrows between each pair of points in Fig. 5. For any case in which no gap appears in the line between the points representing the pair of colors, the length of the superimposed rectangle should be added to the distance between the points, to obtain the representation of the corresponding mean judged scale value. Comparison of Fig. 5 with Fig. 1 indicates the

improvement of modeling of color differences obtained by use of Eqs. (3a) and (3b).

The root-mean-square error of simulation of the 104 perceptual scale values by distances between corresponding points in the three-dimensional space  $ (\mathcal{L}, g, j) $ , taking into account the unintended differences of luminous reflectances between the tiles judged, is 0.45, or 18% of the overall mean of their scale values.

The 24 perceptual scale values of the color differences between colors in the four tetrahedra were simulated, by the computed distances in the color space, with an rms error of 0.38, 13% of the mean of the 24 scale values.

When all 128 scale differences were included (each of the 24 tetrahedron differences was assigned three times as much weight as each of the 104 purportedly equal-luminous-reflectance color differences because the latter were, on the average, judged by only one-third as many observers) the rms error of simulation was 0.42, or 17% of the weighted-mean scale value. The weighted correlation of the 128 computed values with the scale values was 0.74.

## LIGHTNESS COMPONENTS OF JUDGED COLOR DIFFERENCES

According to Eqs. (1)–(3) some of the lightness differences between the tiles that were intended to have equal luminous reflectances were rather significant. For example, color difference 99 has a computed lightness component  $ \Delta\pmb{\mathscr{L}} $  that is 52% as great as the total computed color difference,  $ [(\Delta\pmb{\mathscr{L}})^{2}+(\Delta\pmb{g})^{2}+(\Delta\pmb{j})^{2}]^{\dagger} $ . The lightness component  $ \Delta\pmb{\mathscr{L}} $  is 61% as great as the chromatic component

 $$ [(\Delta g)^{2}+(\Delta j)^{2}]^{\frac{1}{2}} $$ 

that is represented by the distance between points 27 and 28 in Fig. 5. Tile 27 was 1.1 committee units lighter than sample 28. The percentages mentioned are 100 times the sine and tangent, respectively, of the inclination  $ 31.6^{\circ} $  of the line connecting the points representing the colors of the tiles 27 and 28, measured from the constant-lightness plane.

Difference 27 has a lightness component 47% as great as the total color difference. Difference 70 has 45%; differences 68 and 73 both have 44%; 90 has 42.5%, and 117 has 41%. Thirty-nine of the 104 color differences between pairs of the tiles that were intended to have equal luminous reflectances have lightness components greater than 20% of their total color differences and 36 of the remainder (75 altogether) have lightness components greater than 10% of their total color differences. Some of the computed lightness differences can be attributed to differences of the luminous reflectances of the corresponding tiles. However, in some cases, such differences, were made more noticeable, in other cases less. In some cases, the lightnesses of pairs of samples that had equal luminous reflectances differed and were computed to do so, because of the influence of chromaticness on lightness, as indicated by Eq. (2).

A check experiment was made, in which 10 persons separately judged some of the pairs for lightness differences. They were merely asked to indicate which tile was the lighter in natural daylight. Table III shows the results. On the average, five judgments in agreement with a calculated difference would be expected as a result of guessing, if the difference was too small to see. Agreement or disagreement of six judges with the computed difference is not significant, but agreement or disagreement of eight or more judges is significant. Significant agreement with the computed differences was obtained in all cases except one (pair 70) in which the computed difference was 1.0 or more committee.

On the other hand, significant agreement was obtained for pair 95, for which the computed lightness difference was only 0.1 unit. The ratios of the computed lightness differences to the total computed color differences are indicated in Table I.

## REGULAR-RHOMBOHEDRAL SAMPLING OF THE COMMITTEE COLOR SPACE

In the year of formation of the committee (1947), Carl Foss advocated selection of colors to correspond to the vertices of a family of regular tetrahedra. $ ^{15} $  In early committee meetings, he showed charts containing colors in the four triangular arrangements and three square arrangements that correspond to the densest cleavage planes of two regular-rhombohedral lattices in color space, one of which displayed equal-lightness colors in square arrays, whereas the other had them in triangular arrays.

In 1954, Wyszecki published a regular-rhombohedral sampling of Munsell renotation space. $ ^{[16]} $  His sampling specified colors at the vertices of equilateral triangles in planes of constant lightness. Thus, each such color would have six equally near neighbors that have its own lightness. Although, in a regular-rhombohedral lattice, there are seven sets of parallel cleavage planes, four of which consist of planes in which colors are arranged at vertices of equilateral triangles and three of which consist of planes at which the colors are spaced (at those same distances) at the corners of squares, none of the six other sets of cleavage planes is perpendicular to any one of the planes in which the colors are arranged triangularly. On the other hand, the three sets of cleavage planes that have the colors arranged at the corners of squares are mutually perpendicular to each other.

A very simple three-integer scheme of lattice-point identification is possible if a plane in which the lattice points are arranged in squares is used as a reference plane. The committee decided to make each cleavage plane of one of the sets in which the colors are arranged in squares contain colors of equal lightness (£, not luminous reflectance Y). In order to assign a zero index of lightness to the medium gray (30% reflectance) background with which the committee's judgments were made, the corresponding value 14.4 was subtracted from all values of £. To simplify the lattice-point identifications, a new lightness designation was adopted,  $ L = (\mathcal{L} - 14.4)/\sqrt{2} $ . A plot of  $ Y_{0} $  vs L is shown in Fig. 6.

The committee's regular-rhombohedral sampling is defined by the rule that the values of L, j, g for each sample are either all even or all odd integers. The integers L, g, j, may be either positive, zero, or negative, in all combinations, but for any one sample all three integers must be either all odd or all even, where zero is considered even. Because g=j=0 represent grays, there are no grays in the groups of colors for odd values of L. The gray scale consists only of samples that have even values of L. The distance  $ \DeltaL=2\sqrt{2} $  between the grays or between any other colors that have identical values of g and j, with  $ \DeltaL=2 $ , is therefore  $ \sqrt{2} $  times as great as the distance (two committee units of color difference) between nearest neighbors throughout the sam

pling, or more than 40% greater than the distances between nearest neighbors.

Figure 7 indicates the samples of lightness zero (perceptually equal to the lightness of a gray that has 30% reflectance, shown by the open circle in Fig. 7) that the committee hopes to obtain. The unsymmetrical distribution of the points is a consequence of limitations of available pigmented coatings that have adequate opacity and that are sufficiently stable (free from fading or other deterioration) to be suitable for inclusion in a reasonably permanent set of color materials. The chromaticities of these colors are indicated on the CIE x,y diagram in Fig. 8. When the samples have been made and released for distribution, the committee intends to determine their spectral reflectances and to publish their colorimetric specifications.

Figure 9 indicates the samples for L=1 by plus symbols on a g,j diagram. The CIE x,y chromaticities for the L=1 samples are shown in Fig. 10. For comparison with the samples for L=1, the locations of the samples for L=0 are again shown, as open circles, in Fig. 9. Note that the plus signs (samples for L=1) are at the centers of the squares formed by the samples for L=0.

Except for variations of shape of the outer boundary, the open circles indicate the g,j values for all samples that have even values of L and the plus symbols indicate the g,j values for all samples that have odd values of L. Figure 9 shows that each color has twelve nearest neighbors, four in its own plane of constant lightness, four that have one unit greater L, and four that have one unit less L. The eight that have one unit greater or less L also differ from the starting color by one unit of both g and j.

Figure 10a indicates the CIE x,y chromaticities of the planned colors that have L=1. Figure 10b indicates the intended chromaticities of the L=2 colors. Figure 10c indicates those of the L=3 colors, Fig. 10d those of the L=4 colors. Figures 11a–11f indicate the chromaticities planned for the L=-1 to -6 sets, respectively.

The arrangement of the colors on each of the cleavage planes that is perpendicular to the constant-lightness planes is indicated in Fig. 12. In such cleavage planes, all nearest neighbors differ by one unit of all three parameters, L, g, j. In each cleavage plane of one such set,  $ g+j $  is a constant. That constant is necessarily an even integer; it therefore changes by two units from one to the next parallel cleavage plane. That constant is zero in Fig. 12. Cleavage planes of this set that contain some of the planned colors have values of the constant that range from -10 to  $ \pm10 $ . In each cleavage plane of the set that is perpendicular to the L=constant plane and to the  $ g+j $  = constant plane, the difference g-j is a constant. The constant must, in this case also, be an even integer. Such cleavage planes that contain some of the planned colors have values of the constant that range from -10 to +10.

The four sets of cleavage planes that represent colors arranged in equilateral triangles are oblique to all three L, g, j axes. In crystallographic notation, they are the 1,1,1 and 1,1,-1, the 1,-1,1, and the 1,-1,-1 planes. For those not accustomed to crystallographic notation, the planes are parallel to the triangular corners of the cubo-octahedron shown in Wyszecki's Fig. 10. $ ^{16} $  His

of the committee’s arrangements with respect to the L axis and to the g or j axes.

The four sets of triangular arrangements of the committee's colors are characterized, respectively, by the relations  $ L+g=C $ , L-g=C,  $ L+j=C $ , L-j=C. These constants can be any integers, ranging from about -10 to +10 for cleavage planes that contain some of the committee's colors. Many of these arrangements, and of the square arrangements, of the first approximations to the committee's colors were shown at the 1973 Rochester meeting of the Optical Society. $ ^{8} $  A model of part of the committee's sampling, consisting of close-packed spheres to which were attached appropriate samples of colored paper, was also exhibited at that meeting.

A book is planned that will contain color photographs showing the committee’s complete set of colors arranged in all seven possible ways. Photographs of partial and complete models consisting of appropriately painted spheres, suspended free from each other so that the interior spheres can be seen, will also be included.

## COLOR DIFFERENCES IN OSA COMMITTEE COLOR SPACE

The separation between each color and each of its twelve nearest neighbors in the committee's sampling is two units of computed color difference. The square of the distance in the committee's color space between any two of the committee's colors is  $ 2(\Delta L)^{2} + (\Delta g)^{2} + (\Delta j)^{2} $ , where  $ \Delta L $  is the algebraic difference between the integer values of L for the two colors and  $ \Delta g $ ,  $ \Delta j $  are the algebraic differences between the values of g and j respectively. A consequence of Eq. (5) and the requirement that L, g, j be all even or all odd for any color is that the square of the distance in committee color

space between any two of its colors is a positive, even number.

A consequence of the regular rhombohedral arrangement of the committee's colors is that each lattice point (color) in addition to being at the distance  $ 2 = \sqrt{4} $  from its twelve nearest neighbors is at the distance  $ 2\sqrt{2} $  from six other colors. The numbers of lattice points at various distances from any particular lattice point, for various combinations L,  $ \Delta g $ ,  $ \Delta j $ , are shown in Table IV. Points specified by interchanging the indicated increments  $ \Delta g $ ,  $ \Delta j $  were included. The total number, up to and including each distance, is given in the next to the last column.

The distance in color space from the reference color to each of the indicated groups is  $ 2\sqrt{n} $ . The totals up to and including each distance S fit the approximate formula  $ 1.14S^{2.82} $ . In the limit, within very large spheres of radius S, the total number of lattice points is  $ \{\pi/(3\sqrt{2})\}S^{3}\cong0.74S^{3} $ .

The number of lattice points within 10 units of distance, i.e., $n=25$, in a plane of constant $L$ at the indicated increment of $L$ above or below any reference lattice point is indicated in Table V.

Although the $L,g,j$ space is a nonlinear transformation of CIE $x,y,Y$ space, distances in it are additive; subjective estimates of color differences are not proportional to such distances but are nonlinearly related to them. Reference 17 suggested use of a power law to estimate the scale values that would have been found for the perceived color differences by the committee's observers. Square roots of twice the distances are listed in the last column of Table IV; the power 0.5 (the square root) was selected arbitrarily. It is well within the range 0.38 to 0.8 reported in Ref. 17.

this calculation, the distances S were multiplied by 2 in order to make the estimate for the visual color differences of the nearest neighbors $(n=1)$ agree with the actual value, 2.0.

## CONCLUSION

In 1947, Foss $ ^{15} $  wrote “This new method of representing the color space is valuable as an aid to visualization of color tolerances, and is startlingly successful in suggesting color harmonies. It is also the basis on which to assemble a collection of color chips of fixed total number that shall have the greatest possibility of including a near match for any color chosen at random.”

The regular-rhombohedral system of color sampling adopted by the Optical Society Committee on Uniform Color Scales provides the maximum possible number and variety of uniform color scales and exhibits the maximum possible variety of relationships among colors. The committee hopes that artists and designers will find it useful in devising new and beautiful arrangements of colors.

Use of a formula based on the reflectances of gray tiles judged by the committee's 76 observers to have the same lightnesses as the chromatic tiles, as reported by G. Wyszecki, J. Opt. Soc. Am. 57, 754 (1967), resulted in a lower correlation of computed color differences with the committee's scale values, for the 128 color differences listed in Table I.
