# BFD (l:c) colour-difference formula Part 1 – Development of the formula

M R Luo and B Rigg

Schools of Studies in Computing, University of Bradford, Richmond Road, Bradford BD7 1DP

The available experimental data relating to small colour differences between pairs of surface colours have been combined together into sets including perceptibility results and acceptability results. Supplementary experiments have been carried out to enable all the previous visual results to be brought on to a common scale, and to provide extra information when this was considered necessary.

A new colour-difference formula, BFD(l:c), has been developed using the combined experimental results. Various aspects of colour differences have been considered in turn to decide the form of formula required, and the constants in the formula have been optimised using the combined perceptibility and acceptability results. The new formula is similar in structure to the CMC(l:c) formula in most respects. However, it was found that a new term was required to take account of the fact that when chromaticity discrimination ellipses calculated from experimental results are plotted in a  $ *b^{*} $  space, they do not all point towards the neutral point. The experimental results were not very consistent with respect to possible tilting of discrimination ellipsoids relative to the xy plane. Overall it seems that any such tilting is quite small and in the direction implicit in the CMC and BFD formulae. Experimental results based on both acceptability and perceptibility judgements form part of the same overall pattern except for the weighting of lightness differences relative to hue and chroma differences.

## I NTRODUCTION

The CMC  $ (l:c) $  colour-difference formula has been shown to give a better agreement with experimental results for small colour differences between surface colours than other published formulae  $ [1-3] $ . The formula is a modification of the JPC79 formula which was based on acceptability results obtained in one study  $ [4,5] $ . The modification overcomes problems arising with very dark colours and near-neutral samples, but for most colour differences the two formulae give very similar results. It is therefore surprising that the CMC  $ (l:c) $  formula gives good agreement with results from perceptibility studies  $ [1,3] $ . However, even when it was first published, it seemed unlikely that the CMC formula was the best that could be obtained.

Considering the agreement between formula and experimental results  $ [1] $ , the typical coefficient of variation values ranges from 30 to 40. This implies that there are errors in the  $ \Delta E $  values (or the visual  $ \Delta V $  values) of the same order. Errors of this magnitude in the  $ \Delta E $  values should show up as clear systematic discrepancies and allow the formula to be suitably modified.

In this paper experimental results from different sources have been used. Visual results from different sources are generally on different scales. Luo and Rigg  $ [6] $  have shown how such results can be combined onto a common scale, making analysis much simpler. Chromaticity discrimination ellipses were determined for 132 colour centres using sets of published data from several sources based on acceptability and perceptibility experiments involving small colour differences. The ellipse dimensions were recalculated after applying simulated experimental errors to the experimental data. If the ellipses changed by more than a reasonable amount, they were considered to be unreliable and were not used. The results showed that the values for the a/b ratio and  $ \theta $  for the reliable ellipses formed a regular pattern. Not surprisingly the sizes of the ellipses were most irregular; there is no reason to suppose that ellipses corresponding to an arbitrary  $ \Delta V $  value from the work reported by Morley et al.  $ [7] $  should correspond in size to those from the Bradford work  $ [8] $  or to those indicating 50% acceptance from McDonald's results  $ [4] $ .

Experiments were carried out in which pairs of samples corresponding to many of the colour centres were assessed against a grey scale. The grey scale ratings were converted to  $ \Delta V $  values proportional to the differences seen. For each new pair of samples the ratio  $ R = \Delta E_{ell} / \Delta V $ , where  $ \Delta E_{ell} $  was obtained from the appropriate ellipse equation, was calculated. The mean of the R values for each colour centre was also calculated and denoted by  $ \bar{R} $ . For McDonald's data set the  $ \bar{R} $  values were generally low, corresponding to low  $ \Delta E_{ell} $  values, i.e. the ellipses were large and based on a relatively slack tolerance limit. Multiplying the a and b values of the ellipses by the average of the R values for the appropriate data sets gave a more regular pattern when the ellipses for all the colour centres were replotted. However, even after allowing for different lightness levels there were still considerable differences in size (up to a factor of three) between neighbouring ellipses. Similarly the  $ \bar{R} $  values for the colour centres within any one data set varied by factors of up to almost four. Using the individual  $ \bar{R} $  values for each colour centre to adjust the ellipse sizes gave a much more regular pattern. Further evidence that the  $ \bar{R} $  values were correct was obtained from considering the ratios of the individual  $ \bar{R} $  values to the average R values for a set. These ratios were plotted on a chromaticity diagram. Careful examination showed no evidence of significant variation of ratio with chromaticity. It was concluded that the relative sizes of the ellipses even for colour centres within one data set were in error by a factor of two or more. By implication, the visual results for each colour centre are on separate scales, but can be converted to a common scale by dividing the original  $ \Delta V $  values for each colour centre by the appropriate  $ \bar{R} $  value.

The  $ \bar{R} $  values were used to adjust the perceptibility visual results onto a common scale so that colour-difference formulae could be tested using the combined perceptibility data, denoted by CP, rather than using each set of data.

separately  $ [3] $ . (Throughout this paper 'set' is used to denote one source, e.g. DF, rather than one individual colour centre, e.g. DF B.) Eleven colour-difference formulae were tested; the CMC (1:1) formula gave the best agreement with the visual results, but the  $ C_{v} $  value of 37 again indicated that the agreement was far from perfect. Furthermore, comparison of the chromaticity discrimination ellipses corresponding to a constant  $ \Delta E $  value according to the CMC formula showed systematic differences from the experimental ellipses. A plot of the adjusted experimental ellipses (solid lines) and constant  $ \Delta E(\text{CMC}) $  ellipses (dashed lines) is given in Figure 1. In general the agreement between formula and experimental ellipses is good, and some of the discrepancies are probably due to experimental error. However, there are also some systematic discrepancies. For the nine colour centres, marked with crosses, in the saturated blue region, all the experimental ellipses have higher  $ \theta $  and a/b values than the formula ellipses.

It was therefore decided to modify the CMC formula further in an attempt to obtain better agreement with the

visual results. The methods adopted to some extent follow those used by McDonald  $ [4,5] $  and Friele  $ [9] $ . In particular we have followed McDonald in considering different components (lightness, chroma, etc.) separately. In some cases extra pairs of samples were prepared and the results incorporated into the combined set of perceptibility data. Development of the final formula was an iterative procedure; new experimental data were incorporated when available and improvements to, for example, the chroma scale were used in developing a new hue scale. The following account is therefore a somewhat simplified version of the work actually carried out.

Part 1 of this paper describes the development of the new formula, while the final formula is specified and tested in Part 2, to be published in the next issue of the Journal.

## COMBINED PERCEPTIBILITY DATA AND ACCEPTABILITY DATA

Most of the experimental results used in this work consisted of those used in the calculations described previously  $ [6] $ . Table 1 lists the sources of data and the number of pairs  $ (n) $  used from each individual source in the combined set of perceptibility data (CP) or combined set of acceptability data (CA). More detail has been given previously  $ [6] $ . The BFL set includes the results of experiments designed to enable all the visual results to be brought onto a common scale  $ [6] $ ; it also includes the results of experiments designed to fill gaps or inconsistencies in the available data revealed by the calculations reported in the present paper. The new BFL visual results were again based on the use of a grey scale  $ [6] $  and hence gave  $ \Delta V $  values on the same scale as the earlier BFL results and the other adjusted perceptibility results.

Using the BCMC formula described previously [3] (obtained at an intermediate stage of the work described in this paper), $\Delta E/\Delta V$ ratios were calculated for all the pairs of samples. It was found that a surprisingly high percentage of the very high and very low ratios occurred with the BFC [11] set. Most of the perceptibility studies carried out in our work used the ratio assessment method and the raw $\Delta V^{*}$ values were adjusted by Eqn 1:

 $$ \Delta V=(\overline{{\Delta V}}^{*})^{\alpha^{\prime}} $$ 

where  $ \alpha' $  varies with the particular group of observers [8,11].

The value of  $ \alpha^{\prime} $  for the BFC set was 1.89, higher than normal [8]. We decided to recalculate  $ \alpha^{\prime} $  by optimising the six  $ g_{jk} $  ellipsoid constants in Eqn 2 for each colour centre to give the minimum value of e from Eqn 3:

 $$ \begin{aligned}\Delta E=&(g_{11}\Delta x^{2}+2g_{12}\Delta x\Delta y+g_{22}\Delta y^{2}+2g_{13}\Delta x\Delta Y\\&+2g_{23}\Delta y\Delta Y+g_{33}\Delta Y^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}\end{aligned} $$ 

 $$ e=\frac{|\sum(\Delta E-\overline{\Delta V})^{2}/n|^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\overline{\Delta V}} $$ 

where n is the number of pairs at a particular centre.

The  $ \Delta V $  values were obtained from Eqn 1 and the  $ \Delta E $  values were calculated from Eqn 2. The whole calculation was repeated for various values of  $ \alpha' $ . The average e value for the five colours was reduced from 0.18 for  $ \alpha' = 1.89 $  to 0.12 for  $ \alpha' = 1.13 $ . This agrees well with the average e value of 0.13 found earlier [8] and indicates that the new  $ \Delta V $  values calculated from Eqn 1 using the new value of  $ \alpha' $  fit the ellipsoids better. Fortunately the chromaticity discrimination ellipse dimensions calculated using the new  $ \Delta V $  values were very similar to those obtained using the original  $ \Delta V $  values [11]. The  $ \Delta V $  values calculated from Eqn 1 using  $ \alpha' = 1.13 $  were adjusted onto the common scale as usual [3], and when incorporated into the CP data the  $ \Delta E/\Delta V $  values for the BFC set from the BCMC formula were no longer anomalous.

Most of the perceptibility results were in the form of  $ \Delta V $  values proportional to the differences seen and were adjusted to the common visual scale used for the CP data by dividing them by the  $ \bar{R} $  value for each centre  $ \left|6\right| $ . For some of the new perceptibility data  $ \left|13-15\right| $  the observers were asked whether they could see a difference between two samples in a pair; alternatively the observers were asked to compare each difference with a standard difference. The results were expressed as the fraction, P, of the observers who could see a difference, or who considered any particular difference to be larger than the standard difference. The original visual results were converted to  $ \Delta V $  values by means of Eqn 4  $ \left|22\right| $  (results where P=0 and 1 were discarded):

 $$ \Delta V=\frac{1-\ln\left|(1-P)/P\right|/\alpha}{\bar{R}} $$ 

where  $ \alpha $  is a constant obtained from the ellipsoid fitting stage  $ \left|6\right| $  for such data (and acceptability data), and the R values for each centre were obtained previously  $ \left|6\right| $ . (NB The symbols  $ \alpha $  and  $ \alpha' $  should not be confused; there is no connection between the two, but they are used for consistency with earlier papers  $ \left|6,8,11,13,14,22\right| $ .)

A different approach was used to combine the different sources of acceptability data. For about 50% of the centres no chromaticity discrimination ellipse could be obtained, or the ellipse was unreliable  $ [6] $  and hence R values were not available. Furthermore the  $ \alpha $  values for centres within each data set varied over a wide range, e.g. 2.23 to 15.64 for the DF set. Hence  $ \Delta V $  values were calculated from Eqn 5:

 $$ \Delta V=\frac{1-\ln|A/(1-A)|/\alpha_{in}}{\overline{R}} $$ 

where  $ \alpha_{m} $  is the median of the  $ \alpha $  values for the centres within any one set (e.g. DF) for which reliable ellipses were obtained, and A is the percentage of acceptances divided by 100. All the original results with A=0 or A=1 were excluded. No stable ellipsoids were obtained from the VVVR acceptance data, so that these were excluded from the CA results.

Values for  $ \bar{R}^{\prime} $  were calculated as follows, using a technique similar to that used for the indirect  $ \bar{R} $  values [6] for adjusting the ellipses. The 132 reliable experimental ellipses from perceptibility and acceptability results [6], together with 13 determined more recently, were used. The size of each ellipse corresponded to a value of  $ \Delta V $  (grey scale) of unity. For each centre of the acceptability data, the experimental ellipses close to the colour centre (0.025 in xy) were selected and used to obtain the appropriate  $ \bar{R}^{\prime} $  value. In cases where a reliable ellipse was available,  $ \bar{R} $  values calculated by means of the method used for the perceptibility data usually agreed with the  $ \bar{R}^{\prime} $  values to within 20%.

Much of the analysis carried out concerns, directly or indirectly, the  $ \Delta E/\Delta V $  ratios; for a good colour-difference formula the ratios should be constant, with variations in the ratios giving a measure of the failure of a colour-difference formula to fit the experimental results. However, for very small colour differences variations in  $ \Delta E/\Delta V $  can be misleading. For example,  $ \Delta E=0.1 $  and  $ \Delta V=0.1 $  gives a ratio of 1. Small errors in the sample measurements could have given  $ \Delta E=0 $ , or repeat visual assessments could have given  $ \Delta V=0 $ . Hence a  $ \Delta E/\Delta V $  ratio of anywhere between zero and infinity could be obtained. We therefore excluded all pairs of samples for which  $ \Delta V $  was very small. This left 2776 and 1613 pairs in the CP data and the CA data respectively. (Note that we have included results for colour centres for which reliable ellipses could not be obtained [6]. We considered that this was mainly due to poor sample distribution rather than inaccurate results. Our approach has been to use as much data as possible; any selection is subjective, and we believe the general trends will not be lost even if some inaccurate results are included.)

Any colour-difference formula can be tested using the CP and CA results. We have used r,  $ C_{v} $ ,  $ \gamma $  |1,3| and  $ V_{AB} $ |3,13,23| as measures of fit throughout most of this paper.  $ V_{AB} $  is defined by Eqn 6:

 $$ V_{\mathrm{A B}}=\left(\frac{\sum|(\Delta E-F\Delta V)^{2}/\Delta E F\Delta V|}{N}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$ 

 $$ \begin{aligned}where\ F&=\left(\frac{\sum(\Delta E/\Delta V)}{\sum(\Delta V/\Delta E)}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\\N&=number of pairs of samples.\end{aligned} $$ 

For perfect agreement  $ V_{AB} $  should be zero. Such parameters give a measure of the overall agreement or disagreement between the  $ \Delta E $  and the  $ \Delta V $  values, but gives no indication of systematic errors in a formula. Hence we have also used alternative approaches. For example, the chromaticity discrimination ellipses corresponding to constant  $ \Delta E $  should follow the overall pattern shown by the experimental ellipses (see Figure 1).

## DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW COLOUR-DIFFERENCE FORMULA

Several different formulae were used in an attempt to derive the basic form of the new formula. However, none gave

results as good as those obtained by making simple changes to the CMC formula; hence only modifications to the CMC formula are considered in this paper. The final BFD  $ (l:c) $  formula was obtained mainly by optimising the constants in the formula to fit the CP and CA results combined together, using the NAG library routines supplied by the Computer Centre of the University of Bradford [6].

Two new measures of the performance of a formula were devised and defined by Eqns 7 and 8:

 $$ P_{1}=100\left[\gamma+V_{\mathrm{A B}}+(C_{\mathrm{v}}/100)-r\right] $$ 

 $$ P_{i}^{\prime}=\left|\left(\gamma-1\right)+V_{\mathrm{A B}}\right|100+C_{v} $$ 

Eqn 7 combines the four original measures of fit (suitably weighted) into one value, which makes comparisons easier. Along with other workers  $ [23,24] $ , we do not consider r to be a suitable measure of fit, and in optimising constants in the formula  $ P_{i}^{\prime} $  was used. The number of 'wrong decisions' has also been used in previous work involving acceptability data  $ [25] $ . However, the CA results are not in a form where this method can be used. Before optimising constants, each aspect of the formula was considered separately to determine the form required.

## Chroma differences

The pairs for which the differences were essentially chroma differences (actually  $ |\Delta C^{*}|/\Delta E(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})\geq0.85 $ ) were selected from the CP and CA sets separately. In total 745 and 376 such pairs were found for the CP and CA sets respectively.

The ratio of  $ \Delta E(L*a*b*/\Delta V $  for each pair was calculated. For good agreement between the CIE  $ L*a*b* $  formula and the experimental results the ratios should be constant. The mean values of the ratios were calculated for the pairs within each 10C * interval between  $ C*=0 $  and 100, and plotted in Figure 2 as circles and crosses for values from the CP and CA results respectively. It is clear that the points for both types of data agree with each other very well, and as the chroma increases, the mean  $ \Delta E(L*a*b*)/\Delta V $  values increase. The  $ \Delta E(L*a*b*)/\Delta V $  values range from 0.9 to 3.6, suggesting that the CIE  $ L*a*b* $  formula is in error by a factor of four. If the  $ S_{C} $  scale in the CMC formula is correct, then the  $ S_{C} $  values should agree with the ratios from the experimental results. In this and several similar cases throughout this paper it is not necessary that a function should agree with the absolute values of the experimental results. In the present case the  $ S_{C} $  scale could easily be multiplied by a suitable factor if necessary, and the absolute size also depends on the weighting given to lightness and hue differences. In all such cases the function has been multiplied by a suitable factor to make the comparisons easier. The dashed line in Figure 2 corresponds to  $ S_{C} $  multiplied by 1.09 while the solid line corresponds to  $ D_{C} $  multiplied by 1.39, where  $ D_{C} $  is the equivalent scale in the formula finally obtained (called BFD  $ (l:c) $ ) and given by Eqn 9:

 $$ D_{\mathrm{C}}=\frac{0.035\bar{C}^{*}}{1+0.00365\bar{C}^{*}}+0.521 $$ 

The curves both fit the points well. However, the  $ D_{c} $  function was optimised to fit the CP and CA data and therefore is used in the final BFD colour-difference formula. The fact that the S curve, based on acceptability results [4,5], gives a good fit to the CP results strongly suggests that the two types of data have much in common.

## Hue differences

Preliminary calculations suggested that the available results for hue differences were inconsistent and therefore more data were required. Hence 78 pairs differing essentially in hue were prepared; 29 pairs with  $ C^{*} \approx 25 $  and  $ L^{*} \approx 50 $  covered the full hue circle. Other pairs were prepared with the highest chroma values that could be achieved using acid dyes on wool. The hue difference for each pair was at least 85% of the total CIE  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $  colour difference. These results were combined with those for the other pairs from the CP and CA sets for which the differences were essentially in hue (giving 570 and 244 pairs respectively). Plotting  $ \Delta E(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})/\Delta V $  against  $ C^{*} $  gave results similar to those shown in Figure 2. The variation of  $ \Delta E(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})/\Delta V $  with  $ C^{*} $  masks any other possible trends. Hence to investigate the effect of hue,  $ \Delta E(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})/\Delta V D_{C} $  values for each pair were calculated and the mean of these values calculated for each  $ 18^{\circ} $  hue interval from h = 0 to  $ 360^{\circ} $ . The mean values are plotted in Figure 3 (excluding values where the number of pairs was less than five) together with CMC T and BFD  $ T' $  curves multiplied by factors of 1.46 and 1.52 respectively.  $ T' $  is defined by Eqn 10:

 $$ T^{\prime}=0.627+0.055\cos(\bar{h}-254^{\circ})-0.040\cos(2\bar{h}-136^{\circ})+0.070\cos(3\bar{h}-32^{\circ})+0.049\cos(4\bar{h}+114^{\circ})-0.015\cos(5\bar{h}-103^{\circ}) $$ 

The crosses in Figure 3 represent the acceptability results and the circles represent the perceptibility results. The two sets agree well with each other in the hue range 30 to 240°. It is difficult to judge whether the differences between acceptability and perceptibility data at other h values are significant. The lowest value from the CP results occurs at  $ h=290^{\circ} $ . Only three points were available from the CA results for this region, the mean  $ \Delta E(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})/\Delta V D_{C} $  value being 1.54. Further experiments using hue differences be

tween pairs of blue, purple and red samples would be useful.

The BFD  $ T^{\prime} $  curve clearly fits the points better than the CMC T curve, particularly at low h values. The form of equation used for  $ T^{\prime} $  is similar to that used later for  $ R_{T} $ . In contrast to the equation used for the variation of T with h in the JPC79 and CMC formulae, this form gives a smooth continuous curve. It is easier to program and check since alternative forms do not have to be used for different hue ranges.

## Lightness differences

As with the hue differences, the lightness difference results appeared to be inconsistent. Fifty-six new pairs of samples in which the colour differences were principally in lightness were prepared and the results added to the CP data. The samples covered a wide range of chromaticity and lightness. The first approach was similar to that used for chroma and hue differences. In total 276 and 258 pairs for which  $ |\Delta L^{*}|/\Delta E(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})\geq0.85 $  were selected from the CP and CA data respectively. Again the  $ \Delta E(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})/\Delta V $  ratios were calculated for each pair, and the mean values for pairs at  $ 10L^{*} $  intervals are plotted in Figure 4. The CMC  $ S_{1} $ , and  $ \Delta L^{*}/\Delta L $  (BFD) ratios calculated using  $ \Delta Y=0.1 $  (the L (BFD) lightness scale [26] was used in the final BFD  $ (l:c) $  formula) are also shown (multiplied by factors of 1.38 and 1.35 respectively). The mean  $ \Delta E(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})/\Delta V $  ratios from the acceptability data (crosses) were multiplied by a factor of 0.69 to bring them onto the same scale as those from the perceptibility data (circles).

For good agreement between experimental data and the CMC or the BFD formula respectively, the  $ \Delta L^{*}/\Delta L $  (BFD) curve (solid line) or  $ S_{1} $  curve (dashed line) should fit the data points well. For the perceptibility data both functions do roughly fit the experimental results (circles). The  $ \Delta E(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})/\Delta V $  values clearly increase as the lightness ( $ L^{*} $ ) increases, showing that the  $ L^{*} $  scale is not consistent.

with the experimental results. However, the point at  $ L^{*}=63 $  is much lower than the two neighbouring points. Detailed examination showed that 33 out of 50 sample pairs in the  $ L^{*} $  region of 60 to 70 are neutral colours for which the mean  $ \Delta E(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})/\Delta V $  value is 1.12 as opposed to 1.39 for the other 17 pairs. This discrepancy could be associated with some sort of crispening effect, with lightness differences for neutral samples being more clearly visible than the same measured  $ L^{*} $  differences for saturated samples. However, any such effect must be slight [26]. For the acceptability data the lowest and highest  $ \Delta E(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})/\Delta V $  ratios differ by only 37%, as opposed to the 200% variation predicted by the CMC  $ S_{L} $  function. Strangely the CMC  $ S_{L} $  function, based on acceptability results [4,5], does not fit other acceptability data well and yet fits the perceptibility data.

The second approach was to incorporate different lightness scales into the BFD  $ (l:c) $  formula (using a suitable weighting factor in each case), and to test the agreement between the formulae and the CP and CA experimental data. The results are given in Table 2. For the CP set the BFD lightness scale gives the best fit, although the differences in r, etc. are very small. This raises the question of how significant are these differences. Consider the results from the CMC and CIE  $ L^{*} $  lightness scales. In the CMC formula lightness differences are represented by  $ \Delta L^{*}/S_{1} $  where  $ S_{1} $  ranges from 0.51 to 1.48. Thus the two scales differ by a factor of up to 2.9. Both cannot be correct for any one application. Furthermore from Figure 4 it is clear that the CMC scale fits the perceptibility results much better than does the  $ L^{*} $  scale. Thus the improvement in  $ P_{f} $  from 116.4 for  $ L^{*} $  to 114.1 for the CMC lightness scale must be significant. Presumably the vast majority of the  $ \Delta E $  values are determined mainly by the chroma and hue differences; hence changing the lightness scale will only seriously affect a small proportion of the results. In terms of a plot of  $ \Delta E $  against  $ \Delta V $  values, changing the lightness scale will only alter the positions of a few of the points. If the new scale is better most of the changes will be in a direction that will reduce the scatter, but the overall effect will be small. These

factors must be kept in mind in considering other changes to the formula. Overall, the BFD scale gives the best fit, and since this is also the simplest scale, it is incorporated into the final formula.

Other approaches were also used.  $ \Delta L/\Delta V $  values should be constant, and plotting these values on a chromaticity diagram, and averaging them for particular regions, suggested that they were about 20% lower for near-neutral pairs. However, it was considered that the difference was not sufficiently large to justify further complicating the final formula.

For 80 of the colour centres for which data was available, reliable ellipsoids were obtained. The heights of these (in the Y direction) should all correspond to the same visual difference and hence the equivalent  $ \Delta L $  values should be constant. Yet the  $ \Delta L $  values from the four lightness scales used in Table 2 were far from constant; the results indicate that the dimensions of the 'reliable' ellipsoids were not as accurate as hoped.

## Mixed chroma and hue differences (rotation of ellipses)

Kuehni  $ [28] $  has claimed that one disadvantage of the JPC79 formula is that constant  $ \Delta E $  ellipses based on the formula must all point along lines of constant hue in an  $ a \cdot b \cdot $  plot. The CMC formula suffers from the same defect. Comparison of the experimental and constant  $ \Delta E $  (CMC) ellipses in Figure 1 shows that the CMC ellipses do all point along lines of constant hue, while (particularly for saturated blue centres) the experimental ellipses do not.

One way to overcome this problem is to introduce a  $ \Delta H^{*}\Delta C^{*} $  component into the new colour-difference formula as in Eqn 11:

 $$ \Delta E(BFD) = \left[ \left( \frac{\Delta L(BFD)}{l} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta C^*}{cD_c} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta H^*}{D_H} \right)^2 + R_T \left( \frac{\Delta C^* \Delta H^*}{D_C D_H} \right) \right]^\frac{1}{2} $$ 

where the value of  $ R_{T} $  determines the extent of rotation of the ellipses. Detailed inspection of Figure 1 shows that the rotation required varies with both  $ C^{*} $  and h. It was decided to use Eqn 12 as the basic model and to optimise the constants to fit the CP and CA data sets:

 $$ R_{\mathrm{T}}=R_{\mathrm{H}}R_{\mathrm{C}} $$ 

 $$ \begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{w h e r e}R_{\mathrm{H}}=k_{1}\mathrm{c o s}(\overline{{h}}+k_{2})+k_{3}\mathrm{c o s}(2\overline{{h}}+k_{4})}\\ &{\quad+k_{5}\mathrm{c o s}(3\overline{{h}}+k_{6})+k_{7}\mathrm{c o s}(4\overline{{h}}+k_{8})}\\ &{\quad+k_{9}\mathrm{c o s}(5\overline{{h}}+k_{10})}\\ &{R_{\mathrm{C}}=\overline{{C}}^{*k_{11}}/(\overline{{C}}^{*k_{11}}+k_{12})}\end{array} $$ 

The optimised values of the constants  $ k_{1} $  to  $ k_{12} $  are given in the final specification of the formula (see Eqn 1 in Part 2). The  $ R_{C} $  function in Eqn 12 ensures that no discontinuities are introduced into the formula. For  $ \bar{C}^{*}=0 $ ,  $ R_{C} $  and therefore  $ R_{T} $  are zero. Hence the ellipse for neutral colours is not rotated at all; as  $ \bar{C}^{*} $  increases,  $ R_{C} $  increases smoothly up to a maximum of one and hence rotation increases up to a maximum determined by  $ R_{H} $  (and is therefore different for different h values). A similar method could be used to introduce further features into the formula.

The 145 experimental ellipses (solid lines), enlarged 1.5 times, and the corresponding BFD  $ (l:c) $  formula  $ (\Delta E=2.20) $  ellipses are plotted in Figure 5. The agreement between the experimental ellipses and those from the formula is better in the saturated blue and red regions than that in Figure 1. The  $ \theta $  values for the formula ellipses roughly follow those of the experimental ellipses; however, the  $ \alpha $  values are still somewhat less than those for the experimental ellipses for the most saturated blue colours. Attempts to improve this situation resulted in a considerably more complicated formula, and only marginal reductions in  $ P_{f} $  (and  $ P_{f}^{\prime} $ ).

## Tilting of ellipsoids relative to the chromaticity plane

For 51 of the colour centres the cross-sectional ellipses in three planes, i.e. the  $ \Delta x\Delta y $ ,  $ \Delta x\Delta y $  and  $ \Delta y\Delta Y $  planes, were reliable according to the test used previously [6]. Brown

and MacAdam $ ^{[29]} $  calculated the chromaticity displacement  $ (\Delta x_{m}, \Delta y_{m}) $ , from the centre, of the point of maximum luminance for each of their ellipsoids. If the displacement corresponds to a point outside the xy ellipse tilting is probably important. In general the displacements were small compared with the dimensions of the ellipsoids, indicating that the asymmetries of the ellipsoids with respect to luminance (i.e. tilting) were relatively insignificant. An alternative approach  $ \left[11\right] $  is to consider the ratio of the  $ \Delta E $  values calculated from Eqn 2 (containing six coefficients, denoted by  $ \Delta E_{0} $ ) to the  $ \Delta E $  values calculated taking the  $ g_{13} $  and  $ g_{23} $  constants to be zero, i.e. assuming there is no tilting (denoted by  $ \Delta E_{4} $ ). Any ratio far from one would indicate that tilting was important.

The x and y values of the chromaticity displacement of the points of maximum luminance of the 51 ellipsoids were calculated and the ratio of 'the distance from the centre of the chromaticity ellipse to the displacement point' to 'the distance from the centre to the boundary of the chromaticity ellipse in the same direction' was calculated. The ratio was larger than one, so that the tilting was important, for six of the ellipsoids. The  $ \Delta E_{4}/\Delta E_{6} $  ratios were also calculated for each experimental pair and the maximum and minimum ratios for each colour centre were noted. Detailed examination of the results showed that there was no simple relationship between the  $ \Delta E_{4}/\Delta E_{6} $  ratios and the distance ratios; for example, for the ISCC B and BFC Y centres the maximum  $ \Delta E_{4}/\Delta E_{0} $  ratios were similar (1.44 and 1.66), while the distance ratios were quite different (0.2 and 1.1 respectively). Since it is the accuracy of the  $ \Delta E $  values that determines the usefulness of a colour-difference formula, the  $ \Delta E_{4}/\Delta E_{0} $  values probably give the more reliable indication of the importance of the tilting. For the 37 centres for which all the  $ \Delta E_{4}/\Delta E_{0} $  values were within the range 0.7 to 1.4, the tilting was considered to be insignificant.

The  $ \Delta x_{m}\times10^{4} $  and  $ \Delta y_{m}\times10^{4} $  values are plotted on an xy chromaticity diagram in Figure 6. The values have been adjusted by multiplying by  $ (Y/30)^{1/5} $  as discussed previously [6] and all correspond to  $ \Delta V $  (grey scale) equal to one. The agreement between the results for neighbouring ellipsoids is poor in many cases. For example, in Figure 6(a), for the JK25 centre  $ (x=0.28, y=0.41) $   $ \Delta x_{m}\times10^{4} $  is -97, whereas the values for most of the neighbouring ellipsoids are positive, while in Figure 6(b), for the KMET A centre  $ (x=0.32 $  and  $ y=0.50) $   $ \Delta y_{m}\times10^{4} $  is 80, whereas four neighbouring ellipsoids give negative values. To simplify the pattern we have divided the chromaticity diagram into six regions. The boundaries were chosen partly with a view to enclosing centres with similar values, and partly by drawing the boundaries along natural gaps between the centres. The mean values, standard deviations and numbers of ellipsoids within each region are given in Table 3. Despite the obvious inconsistency of many of the individual values, the regional means do seem to form a pattern. In particular, for high x values the  $ \Delta x_{m} $  values (region 1, Figure 6(a)) are almost all negative, while for x<0.36 nearly all the  $ \Delta x_{m} $  values are positive. Similarly for  $ \Delta y_{m} $  the most positive values generally occur at high x values (region 1 in Figure 6(b)). The  $ \Delta x_{m} $  and  $ \Delta y_{m} $  values corresponding to the BFD formula ellipsoids  $ (\Delta E=1.45) $  for the 51 centres were also calculated. The means and standard deviations of the  $ \Delta x_{m} $  and  $ \Delta y_{m} $  values for each region are also given in Table 3. Considering the large error for some of the individual experimental ellipsoids, the agreement between experiment and formula is considered to be good. The largest difference between the experimental and formula means is in region 2, where the  $ \Delta y_{m}\times10^{4} $  values differed by 31. However, all the chromaticity discrimination ellipses in that area are large (mean a=0.0126) and the major axis is parallel to the y-axis and hence the difference is relatively unimportant. The overall picture suggests that the tilting in all six regions is not very significant and that the tilting predicted by the formula agrees reasonably well with that found by experiment.

Since the individual experimental ellipsoids are not particularly reliable an alternative approach is to derive 'typical' experimental ellipsoids (based on the mean a, a/b,  $ \theta $ , etc. values for the experimental ellipsoids in a particular region), and to compare these with the corresponding formula ellipsoids. This was done for centres in each of the regions in

SD -- standard deviation

Figure 6(a and b). The results showed that the agreement between formula and experiment was good, except for the ellipsoids in region 6 (Figure 6(a), Table 3). However, in this case the discrepancies were mainly attributable to differences between the formula and experimental chromaticity discrimination ellipses, rather than differences in degree of tilting. Setting the  $ g_{13} $  and  $ g_{23} $  coefficients in the ellipsoid formulae (Eqn 2) to zero again showed that the tilting according to both formula and experiment was never significant. It was therefore considered that no attempt should be made to alter the degree of tilting implied by the formula.

New experiments were carried out to check the results for four centres for which the  $ \Delta x_{m} $  (JK25, MMB OC, MMB SP) or  $ \Delta y_{m} $  (MMB RG) values were particularly anomalous. For example, for centre MMB OC the original  $ \Delta x_{m} $  value (Figure 6(a)) was far higher than the regional mean. However, because the centre corresponded to a more saturated colour than most others in the region, it seemed possible that the result could be correct. For each centre seven to nine pairs were prepared giving a good coverage of the possible directions in one particular plane (xY or yY), while keeping differences in the third dimension to a minimum.

The  $ \Delta x_{m} $  or  $ \Delta y_{m} $  values from the new experiments are given in Table 4. The corresponding values from the original experimental ellipsoids and the regional means for experimental ellipsoids (adjusted to correspond to the Y values for each centre) are also given. The results indicated that none of the new experimental ellipses showed significant tilting, and the  $ \Delta x_{m} $  and  $ \Delta y_{m} $  values were much lower than those from the original experimental ellipsoids. The new results provide no support whatsoever for the original results for these centres. There is no indication that tilting becomes significant for very saturated colours.

In conclusion, it seems clear that tilting is generally unimportant. The results for individual centres are not very accurate. The mean values for each region provide a much better guide. Agreement between experiment and the BFD formula is satisfactory.

## Checking some of the chromaticity discrimination ellipses

Some of the 'reliable' ellipses obtained earlier  $ [6] $  do not fit into the general pattern in the chromaticity diagram. The a/b ratios are 1.32 and 1.48 for the MMB RO and GY centres respectively, much lower than the regional means of 2.9 and 2.1  $ [6] $ . However, the two centres correspond to the most saturated colours in the two regions and the results could therefore be correct. New sample pairs were prepared with a good coverage of all possible directions in the  $ \Delta x \Delta y $  plane (18 and 17 pairs corresponding to the RO and GY colour centres respectively). The new ellipse parameters together with the mean a/b and  $ \theta $  values obtained previously for the two regions are given in Table 5. The a/b values for both new ellipses are higher than those for the original ellipses and fit the overall pattern better. The values for both new ellipses agree with the appropriate regional means to within 3°. The sizes of the original experimental ellipses, adjusted using results obtained two years earlier with a somewhat different panel of observers, agree well with those of the new ellipses. This provides further evidence that the relative size experiments described previously are reasonably accurate  $ [6] $ . Again, the new results suggest that the overall pattern found in this earlier study is correct, and that results for individual ellipses not conforming to the overall pattern are probably incorrect.

# Cuticular ‘cell membrane complex’ modification of wool fabrics by sulphite treatment in aqueous organic solvent media

Cuticle modification on knitted wool fabrics treated with sodium sulphite in an isopropanol water medium has been studied. Isolation of the cuticle and its components, as well as amino acid composition determinations after acid and enzymatic hydrolysis from untreated and treated wool, indicate only slight modification. However, from the amino acid composition of the lipoproteic material dissolved during the treatment and from transmission electron microscopic observations, a modification of the δ-layer in the cuticle–cuticle 'cell membrane complex' has been clearly observed.

## I NTRODUCTION

Details of the treatment of knitted wool fabrics with sodium sulphite in an isopropanol/water medium to confer shrink-proofing properties under particular conditions of solvent concentration and temperature have been published  $ [1] $ . Under such treatment partial solubilisation of lipoprotein material takes place  $ (2.5–4\%\ o.w.f.) $  and analysis indicates both the removal of some polar and apolar lipids and the existence of a relationship between the amount of dissolved protein and the shrinkproofing effect  $ [2] $ . The shrink-proofing effect is generally attributed to physico-chemical modifications at cuticular level  $ [3,4] $ . Separation and amino acid analysis of the cuticle and its components, endocuticle and exocuticle plus the 'cell membrane complex' (CMC) between cuticular cells of untreated and treated fibres, were therefore carried out to find out which structural fraction of the keratin fibre was modified. The amino acid composition was determined using acid hydrolysis, although enzymatic hydrolysis was employed for the asparagine, glutamine and glutamyl lysine content. The amino acid composition of the cuticle and its various components from untreated and treated fibres was compared with that of the lipoprotein material dissolved during treatment in the presence of sodium sulphite. Transmission electron micrographs (t.e.m.) were also obtained and they clearly support the analytical results.

## EXPERIMENTAL

## Materials

Fabrics knitted to a cover factor of 12.6 from R72-tex/2 botany wool yarns were supplied by the International Wool Secretariat, llkley, UK. Before being treated, the fabrics were cleaned by Soxhlet extraction with dichloromethane, rinsed with ethanol and water, and equilibrated in a conditioned room (20°C, 60% r.h.). The chemicals used were laboratory grade for treatments and analytical grade for analysis. The equipment used included a shaker bath with a thermostat (Julabo VL), centrifuge (Beckman J21C with Rotor JS-13), amino acid analyser (Biotronic LC6000E), Starmix mixer and a Philips EM301 transmission electron microscope.

## Treatments

Dried and weighed wool fabrics were treated for 1 h at  $ 55^{\circ} $ C in a 50% isopropanol/water solution (liquor ratio 30:1 vol./wt), placed in a thermostated shaker bath (treatment A) and in the same conditions plus 1.5% sodium sulphite (treatment B). Shrinkage is not prevented by treatment A but treatment B does prevent shrinkage.
