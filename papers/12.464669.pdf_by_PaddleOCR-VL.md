## ABSTRACT

An experiment was carried out using CRT colours. The stimuli were selected along 24 vectors in CIELAB colour space. The data was used to test various colour difference formulae and uniform colour spaces. The results show that there are some discrepancies between CIELAB space and experimental data. The results also suggest that there are three types of colour models according to the data used to develop these models: small colour-difference, large colour-difference and Munsell data.

Keywords: Colour difference formula, uniform colour space, CIELAB, IPT, GLAB.

### 1. INTRODUCTION

Much research work has been conducted to derive a universal uniform colour space where equal distances in that space correspond to equal perceived colour differences. In 1976, CIE recommended the CIELAB $ ^{1} $  space as a uniform colour space for industrial application. It has been widely used in many industries, such as textiles, paints etc. However, it was later found that it does not fit well to the experimental data with small to medium magnitudes of colour differences. It also has a shortcoming: colours along a constant hue angle in blue region appear to have a large hue shift. $ ^{2,3} $  Although CIE has just recommended a new colour difference formula, CIEDE2000, $ ^{4} $  nevertheless it is still a modification to the CIELAB and does not have an associated with a colour space. Hence, the search for a universal uniform colour space is still continuing.

In this study, five types of scales in CIELAB colour space were investigated: hue, lightness, chroma, a light series and a dark series. The names of the 'light' and 'dark' series are only used here, but are not defined by CIE. The latter four directions are illustrated in Figure 1(a) at a constant CIELAB hue angle. For the lightness scale, the colours were all neutral, i.e.,  $ C^{*}=0 $ , and  $ L^{*} $  ranged from 5 to 95. For the 'light series',  $ L^{*} $  decreased from 95 to 50 while  $ C^{*} $  increased from 0 to the maximum value. The hue was constant, but the experiment was repeated at five different hues. For the hue scales, the hue circle was divided into four quadrants which were investigated separately. For one series of experiments,  $ L^{*} $  and  $ C^{*} $  were fixed at 50 and 30 respectively, while for a second series, different values of  $ L^{*} $  and  $ C^{*} $  were chosen for each quadrant to maximise the chroma which could be studied. (see Figure 1(b)).

Experimental software was developed to allow observers to adjust colours along each scale on a CRT display. The visual results were accumulated for discerning the non-uniformity of CIELAB space. The results were also used to test various colour spaces and colour difference formulae.

### 2. EXPERIMENT

The experiment was conducted using a Barco Reference Calibrator with a white point set to illuminant D65 and CIE 1931 standard colorimetric observer. The GOG $ ^{5,6} $  model was used to characterise the monitor. The experiment was conducted in a

darkened room. Ten normal colour vision observers aged between 25 and 35 years old took part in the experiment. Each observer repeated the experiment twice. Twenty-four vectors corresponding to the five CIELAB scales introduced earlier were studied. Figure 2(a) shows a scale including 9 colours against a grey background with  $ L^{*} $  of 50. The 24 vectors studied are described in Table 1 including one lightness, five chroma, eight hue-angle, five light series and five dark series. The two ends of each vector are also given in Table 1. There are five chroma vectors, light series and dark series at hue angles of  $ 42^{\circ} $ ,  $ 139^{\circ} $ ,  $ 305^{\circ} $ ,  $ 102^{\circ} $  and  $ 330^{\circ} $  corresponding to the CRT's first and secondary primaries (red, green, blue, yellow and magenta). Each hue vector only covers  $ 90^{\circ} $  (a quadrant) as shown in Figure 1(b).

<div style="text-align: center;">Table 1. Experimental conditions</div>


In Figure 2(a), each observer was asked to fill in the colours between the two fixed ends based upon their own visual judgement. The aim was to make the colour differences between each pair of neighbouring samples look the same. They used three control bars: L*, C*, hue and 'series' to adjust colours. For adjusting the lightness scale, the L* control bar was used. Observers used the C* and hue control bars for adjusting colours in chroma vectors. (The chroma bar was used to adjust the sizes of the steps, while the hue bar was used only to make the hues of all the samples look the same). For adjusting the hue vectors, observers only used the hue control bar. For vetors of light and dark series, observers used both the 'series' and hue control bars. The inclusion of hue adjustments to the chroma scale and dark and light series was to investigate the degree of hue changes in these vectors. After the experiment, the L*, C* and hue angle values were averaged for each colour patch to represent the mean visual results.

<div style="text-align: center;">(b) The experimental condition for scaling colour differences.</div>


A supplementary experiment (see Figure 2(b)) was later conducted to bring the colour differences of all vectors into one visual scale. Observers adjusted the colour differences of all the other vectors (3 colours in the bottom row) to agree with those of lightness vector (top row). Each vector was divided into three parts, i.e. patches 1-3, 4-6 and 7-9.

### 3. RESULTS

Finally, 144 colour differences calculated between two neighbouring colours in each vector were gathered with a mean of  $ 10\Delta E^{*_{ab}} $ . These were used to examine the uniformity of CIELAB colour space. In Figure 3 the original lightness results ( $ L^{*} $ ) are plotted against the measured results for the samples which the observers considered to be equally spaced ( $ L^{*}_{v} $ ). The  $ L^{*} $  results have an equal step, i.e.  $ (95-5)/8=11.25 $ . The same principle applies to chroma results as shown in Figure 4 for the blue hue. For a perfect agreement between the visual results and CIELAB scales, all data should fall on the  $ 45^{\circ} $  line. Obviously, this is not the case for both scales as most points are above the  $ 45^{\circ} $  line. Figure 3 shows that the experimental results agree with the

L* scale for  $ L^{*}<40 $ , but not for the lighter colours. For the chroma results, the CIELAB C* values in Figure 4 run from 0 to 90. Thus a colour with C*=45 might be expected to fall in the middle of the set. However it can be seen that the midpoint actually occurs at  $ L^{*}<40 $ . This implies that a chroma change of C*=0 to 45 looks larger than one corresponding to C*=45 to 90. This is consistent, at least qualitatively, with results for experiments involving small colour differences.

<div style="text-align: center;">Figure 6. The results for Light and dark series plotted in  $ a^{*}b^{*} $  diagram.</div>


Figures 5 and 6 show the visual results for the chroma vector, and light and dark series for each of the 5 hues plotted in the CIELAB  $ a^{*}b^{*} $  diagram. For a perfect agreement between the visual results and CIELAB space, the experimental visual results for each hue should fall on a straight line. Both figures reveal that some curvature occurs for blue hues. This implies that constant hue angle in CIELAB space does not correspond to a constant hue as judged visually, at least for blue colours. A similar effect was found for the light and dark series, again for blue hues (see Figure 6). Overall, it can be concluded that there are systematic discrepancies between the experimental data and CIELAB colour space.

Finally, the experimental visual results were then used to test 11 colour difference formulae and colour spaces: 1) CMC, $ ^{7} $  2) CIE94, $ ^{8} $  3) CIEDE2000, $ ^{4} $  4) GLAB, $ ^{9} $  5) OSA, $ ^{10} $  6) IPT, $ ^{2} $  7) CAM97s2, $ ^{11} $  8) CIELAB, $ ^{1} $  9) Kuehni, $ ^{12} $  10) SVF, $ ^{13} $  and 11) NC_IIIC, $ ^{14} $ . Models 1-3 were developed to fit small colour differences, and the other models to fit large colour differences. Also, Models 1 to 6 are colour difference formulae, and the other models are uniform colour spaces. The performance factor divided by three (PF/3) is used as a measure of fit $ ^{9} $ . For a perfect agreement, PF/3 should equal to zero. A PF/3 of 30 means a 30% disagreement between the formula or space's predictions and the visual results. The results are summarised in Table 2. For each model, a lightness weighting factor was also optimised in order to improve each model's performance.

Table 2 shows that PF/3 values are more than 30 for Models 1-3 and 9-11 but less than 30 for Models 4-8. The GLAB and IPT models gave the most accurate prediction amongst all the models tested. The results also indicate that there are large differences amongst these three groups of models. The current results confirmed the authors' earlier study  $ {}^{15} $  using many other datasets that the colour models can be divided into three categories according to the data used to develop these models: small colour-difference (1-3), large colour-difference (4-8) and Munsell data (9-11).

### 4. CONCLUSIONS

An experiment was carried out using a CRT display. Observers were asked to adjust colours on 24 directions in CIELAB space to form equally spaced series. The results showed that there are systematic discrepancies between the visual results and CIELAB space. The data were also used to test 11 colour spaces and colour difference formulae. It was found that the models can be divided into three groups according to the data used to develop these models: small colour-difference, large colour-difference and Munsell data.
