Abstract: The performances of uniform colour spaces and colour-difference formulae for predicting threshold colour differences were investigated based on visual assessments of 893 pairs of printed colour patches under a D65 source. The average  $ \Delta E^{*}_{ab,10} $  of the pairs was 1.1 units. A threshold psychophysical experiment was repeated 3 times by a panel of 16 observers with normal colour vision. The experimental data were used to evaluate ten colour-difference formulae and uniform colour spaces using STRESS measure. The results indicated that all formulae and spaces performed very similar with each other, and outperformed CIELAB for threshold colour differences. The chromaticity-discrimination ellipses were used to compare with previous results.

from small colour differences and they agreed with each other except purple colour centre.

## I NTRODUCTION

In the last four decades, various uniform colour spaces and their corresponding colour-difference formulae have been proposed, such as the CIELAB [1], DIN99 [2], OSA [3] and CIECAM02 [4]. However, more and more visual experiments and data analyses indicate that the colour spaces and formulae do not perform well for ultra-small colour difference, especially with CIELAB  $ \Delta E^{*}_{ab,10} $  less than 1 [5-7]. For threshold colour differences there is larger dispersion when plot the visual assessment data against the calculated colour differences. It has been also reported [8] that colour pairs with very small colour differences (below 1.0 CIELAB units, approximately) in a highly reliable dataset had a lower consistency degree. The CIE technical committee 1-55 Uniform colour space for industrial colour difference evaluation was formed with an aim to propose a uniform colour space to replace the currently widely used CIELAB space. It is urgent to collect experimental data from different laboratories and industries to derive and test a new uniform colour space [9]. The CIE technical committees 1-63 “Validity of the range of CIE DE2000” and 1-81 “Validity of Formulae for Predicting Small Colour Differences” are also involved in the evaluation of threshold colour differences. The former targeted “To investigate the application of the CIEDE2000 equation at threshold, up to CIELAB colour differences greater than 5”, and the latter is going “to evaluate available formulae for

small colour differences ( $ <\sim2.0 $  CIELAB) and to define a visual threshold colour difference."

This paper describes a new data set with a mean colour difference of  $ 1.1 \Delta E^{*}_{ab,10} $  units. The visual experiment was carried out using printed colour patches and with the threshold (pass/fail) psychophysical method by a panel of 16 observers with normal colour vision, each repeated 3 times.

## EXPERIMENTAL

## Sample Preparation

The samples surrounding 17 colour centres recommended by the CIE [10] were printed at a resolution of  $ 2880 \times 1440 $  (dpi) by an EPSON Stylus PRO 7800 ink-jet printer on a substrate with a gloss level of 56 units measured in the angle of  $ 75^{\circ} $  by a VGS-SGNSOR Gloss Meter. The size of the samples was  $ 4.5 \times 4.5 $  cm $ ^{2} $ . Each sample was measured by an X-Rite SpectroEye Spectrophotometer at the geometry of  $ 0^{\circ} \cdot 45^{\circ} $  in terms of spectral reflectance. The tristimulus values were then calculated under CIE illuminant D65 and CIE 1964 standard colorimetric observer. The distributions of the measured colour centres on CIELAB  $ a^{*}_{10}b^{*}_{10} $  and  $ C^{*}_{ab,10}L^{*}_{10} $  planes are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. In Fig. 1, the figure in each square indicates the serial number of the colour centre as shown in the first column of Table 1.

Around each colour centre, 50-60 colour samples and 893 pairs in total were prepared to carry out the visual assessments. The colour differences between the samples and their corresponding colour centre were ranged from 0.1 to 5.3 CIELAB units with an average colour difference of 1.1 CIELAB units, for which the average of absolute values of  $ \Delta L^{*}_{10} $ ,  $ \Delta C^{*}_{ab,10} $  and  $ \Delta H^{*}_{ab,10} $  were 0.44, 0.70 and 0.48 respectively. The distribution of the  $ \Delta E^{*}_{ab,10} $  values is shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen from Fig. 2

that there were about 57% and 89% of pairs with colour difference less than 1 and 2 CIELAB units respectively in this study.

All the samples were chosen to be well distributed surrounding the colour centre and covered many different directions in the CIELAB space. As an example, Fig. 3 gives the distribution of the yellow samples (colour centre #6) in CIELAB  $ \Delta a^{*}_{10}\Delta b^{*}_{10} $  (Fig. 3a) and  $ \Delta L^{*}_{10}\Delta C^{*}_{ab,10} $  (Fig. 3b) planes respectively.

Visually all our samples were carefully chosen and very homogeneous in colour. Strictly speaking our colour samples are constituted by small ink drops constituting a microscopic mosaic structure. It can be thought that while instrumental spectrophotometric measurements, an average was made on this mosaic structure, at the working distance the observers could be influenced by this heterogeneous structure. In our case, we can say that no observer reported problems related with some kind of texture or lack of colour uniformity in the assessed samples. In addition, it has been reported  $ [11] $  that random-dot simulated textures with small size of dots and percentage of covered surface do not produce significant changes in visual tolerances measured for completely uniform non-textured samples.

## V isual Assessments

The visual assessments were conducted in a dark room using a GretagMacbeth Judge II viewing cabinet fitted with a D65 simulator, which had a correlated colour temperature of 6587K, and provided an illuminance of 958 lx at the floor of the cabinet, measured by a Photo-Research PR-650 spectroradiometer. The grey background had CIELAB  $ L^{*}_{10} $ ,  $ a^{*}_{10} $ , and  $ b^{*}_{10} $  coordinates of 50.31, 0.16 and 1.34, respectively. Colour pairs were placed on the centre of the floor of the cabinet, and

visual observations were made at  $ 45^{\circ} $  with respect to the normal to the samples, approximately.

A threshold method was used in the visual experiment for evaluating threshold colour difference (TCD). 16 undergraduate students at the Beijing Institute of Graphic Communication (BIGC), all of them with normal colour vision according to the Ishihara test participated in the experiment. Before the real experiment, observers were trained to assess some colour differences using the threshold method. Before each observing session, observers were asked to adapt to the grey background field for about 1 minute, and during this time the instruction as shown below was read to observers:.

“When a pair of colour samples was presented to you, please judge whether you can distinguish the colour difference between two samples.”

Each pair was assessed by a panel of 16 observers and each observer repeated the trial three times; that is, in total there were 48 visual assessments for each colour pair. In average, each observation session lasted 5 minutes. Each observer took 1-2 observation sessions every time. The maximum time in each experimental session lasted 20 minutes including the rest time to avoid observers' fatigue. After each experimental session, the approximate time between the replications from each observer was 2-3 days. The whole experiment was completed within a two months period.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## Measure of Fit

Recently, the STRESS (Standardized Residual Sum of Squares) index [12] given in Eqs. (1) - (5) has been increasingly used as a measure of the relationship between two

sets of data, and testing the performance of the colour-difference formulae [13]. Note that the following five equations lead to the same STRESS values, where  $ \Delta E_{i} $  and  $ \Delta V_{i} $  ( $ i = 1, \ldots, N $ ) are used to denote for each one of the N colour pairs the computed and visual colour differences, respectively.

 $$ STRESS=100\sqrt{\frac{\sum\left(\Delta V_{i}-f_{1}\Delta E_{i}\right)^{2}}{\sum\Delta V_{i}^{2}}} $$ 

 $$  with\quad f_{1}=\frac{\sum\Delta E_{i}\Delta V_{i}}{\sum\Delta E_{i}^{2}} $$ 

 $$ STRESS=100\sqrt{\frac{\sum\left(\Delta E_{i}-f_{2}\Delta V_{i}\right)^{2}}{\sum\Delta E_{i}^{2}}} $$ 

 $$  with\quad f_{2}=\frac{\sum\Delta E_{i}\Delta V_{i}}{\sum\Delta V_{i}^{2}} $$ 

 $$ STRESS=100\sqrt{\frac{\sum\left(\Delta E_{i}-f_{3}\Delta V_{i}\right)^{2}}{\sum f_{3}^{2}\Delta V_{i}^{2}}} $$ 

 $$  with\quad f_{3}=\frac{1}{f_{1}}=\frac{\sum\Delta E_{i}^{2}}{\sum\Delta E_{i}\Delta V_{i}} $$ 

 $$ STRESS=100\sqrt{\frac{\sum\left(\Delta V_{i}-f_{4}\Delta E_{i}\right)^{2}}{\sum f_{4}^{2}\Delta E_{i}^{2}}} $$ 

 $$  with\quad f_{4}=\frac{1}{f_{2}}=\frac{\sum\Delta V_{i}^{2}}{\sum\Delta E_{i}\Delta V_{i}} $$ 

 $$ STRESS=100\sqrt{1-\frac{\left(\sum\Delta E_{i}\Delta V_{i}\right)^{2}}{\sum\Delta E_{i}^{2}\sum\Delta V_{i}^{2}}} $$ 

where  $ f_{n} $  (n=1-4) are not arbitrary scalars but scale factors chosen for minimising the differences between visual colour differences ( $ \Delta V_{i} $ ) and computed colour differences ( $ \Delta E_{i} $ ).

It is important to note that STRESS was based on the assumption that there is a ratio relationship between two datasets  $ \Delta V $  and  $ \Delta E $ . For a perfect agreement between two datasets, e.g.  $ \Delta E_{i} = f \Delta V_{i} $  for any nonzero values of f, STRESS will be zero. A higher STRESS value indicates a larger dissimilarity between two datasets or far from the ratio condition  $ \Delta E_{i} = f \Delta V_{i} $ . On the contrary, a lower STRESS value indicates a better agreement between two sets of data.

For evaluating colour differences in term of STRESS, it is important to exclude the intercept term between  $ \Delta V $  and  $ \Delta E $  [14]. A certain amount of systematic errors may be introduced in STRESS if a nonzero intercept  $ (b) $  exists between  $ \Delta V $  and  $ \Delta E $ , i.e.

 $ \Delta E_{i}=f\Delta V_{i}+b $ . Substituting  $ \Delta E_{i}=f\Delta V_{i}+b $  for  $ \Delta E_{i} $  in Eq. (5), the systematic error caused by adding an intercept  $ (b) $  between  $ \Delta V $  and  $ \Delta E $  can be obtained as Eq. (6) in terms of STRESS.

 $$ e=100\sqrt{1-\frac{\left[\sum\Delta V_{i}\left(f\Delta V_{i}+b\right)\right]^{2}}{\sum\Delta V_{i}^{2}\sum\left(f\Delta V_{i}+b\right)^{2}}} $$ 

Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the systematic error  $ (e) $  and slope  $ (f) $  and intercept  $ (b) $ . It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the systematic error increased as the intercept increased. This indicates that more attention should be paid in scaling visual colour difference to satisfy the ratio condition between  $ \Delta V $  and  $ \Delta E $  for minimising the systematic error.

STRESS can also be used to test the statistical significance of difference between two formulae A and B [12, 15]. The testing hypothesis is described as below, for which the residual error variance  $ V_{M} $  (or raw STRESS) given in Eq. (7) was calculated.

(1) Define the null and alternate hypotheses (two-tailed)

 $ H_{0} $ :  $ V_{A} = V_{B} $  (e.g. A and B without significant difference)

 $ H_{A}: V_{A} \neq V_{B} $  (e.g. A and B with significant difference)

(2) Calculate the F value as  $ F = V_{A} / V_{B} $  where

 $$ V_{_{M}}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\Delta V_{_{i}}-f_{_{M}}\Delta E_{_{Mi}}\right)^{2}/(N-1)\quad M\in\left\{A,B\right\} $$ 

 $ f_{M} $  being calculated using  $ f_{l} $  in Eq. (1), which is the slope between the visual results  $ \Delta V $  and the  $ \Delta E $  for models A and B, respectively, and

 $$ F=\frac{V_{_{A}}}{V_{_{B}}}=\frac{\sum\left(\Delta V_{_{i}}-f_{_{A}}\Delta E_{_{Ai}}\right)^{2}}{\sum\left(\Delta V_{_{i}}-f_{_{B}}\Delta E_{_{Bi}}\right)^{2}}=\frac{STRESS_{_{A}}^{2}}{STRESS_{_{B}}^{2}} $$ 

(3) Reject the hypothesis  $ (\mathrm{H}_{0}) $  when  $ F < F_{C} $  or if  $ F > 1 / F_{C} $ 

where  $  F_{C} = F(df_{A}, df_{B}, 0.975)  $  is the lower critical value of two-tailed F distribution with 95% confidence level and  $ df_{A} $  and  $ df_{B} $  are the degrees of freedom.  $ F_{C} $  can be found from statistical textbooks or the Microsoft Excel function DISTR.F.INV (0.975;  $ df_{A} $ ;  $ df_{B} $ ).  $ V_{A} $  and  $ V_{B} $  represent the residual error variances after scaling correction for colour difference equations or uniform colour spaces A and B, respectively. Finally, N is the number of samples in the data set, and  $ df_{A} = df_{B} = N-1 $  in this study. The results can be divided into 5 categories as shown below:

• Model A is significantly better than model B when  $ F<F_{C} $ 

• Model A is significantly worse than model B when  $ F>1/F_{C} $ 

• Model A is insignificantly better than model B when  $ F_{C} \leqslant F < 1 $ 

• Model A is insignificantly worse than model B when 1<F≤1/Fc

• Model A is equal to model B when F = I.

## Observer Variations

Observer variations can be denoted by intra- and inter-observer variability. The raw data accumulated here were described in terms of perceptible percentage, in which a batch sample is judged as a "yes" (with difference) or "no" (without difference) against its standard in percentage  $ (P\%) $ , e.g. an 30 of  $ P\% $  means that 30% of observers can distinguish the difference between two samples. For investigating observer uncertainty, "wrong decision"  $ WD\%\ [16, 17] $  was used, which is the proportion of wrong decision in regard to the whole visual observations.

For investigating inter-observer variability, each individual’s decision and majority’s decision of the panel were compared. If an individual’s decision is a “yes” and majority’s decision is 30% giving “yes” answer, then the majority’s decision is a “no”. Both the individual’s and majority’s decisions thus disagree with each other for

the pair. Hence, it is counted as a “wrong decision” for the given observer who made the decision “yes”. The same principle applies to all observers. Then, the number of “wrong decision” was divided by the total observations to give  $ WD\% $  values for the given pair. Finally, the performance is expressed by the average of  $ WD\% $  for all pairs. For a perfect agreement,  $ WD\% $  will equal to zero.

For examining intra-observer variability, each observer's  $ 1^{st} $  and  $ 2^{nd} $ ,  $ 1^{st} $  and  $ 3^{rd} $ ,  $ 2^{nd} $  and  $ 3^{rd} $  sets of results were compared in terms of WD% measure, which was used to represent number of “wrong decision” made by the replicated judgements for a given observer. The repeated times is 3 for any observers.

The intra- and inter-variability in terms of “wrong decision” (WD%) for this study are shown in Table 2. The results agreed well with those found in a previous study  $ [17] $ , where a serial of threshold experiments were conducted using paint samples and observers’ repeatability and accuracy were found about 27 to 32 in WD% units, respectively.

## Scaling the Visual Colour Differences

As mentioned above, the raw visual data from this study were recorded in the form of perceptible percentage  $ (P\%) $ , i.e. the number of observations of which the colour samples were “yes” or perceived as having difference, divided by the total number of observations for a given pair. In this experiment the total number of observations was  $ 48\,(=16\times3) $  for each pair, and then the  $ P\% $  values were converted to the visual differences  $ (\Delta V) $  based on the average of the judgments of a large number of observations.

In the current experiment, all the judgements are always associated with a tolerance limit or threshold  $ (\Delta V_{T}) $ . If the colour difference of a sample against its

standard is exactly located on the tolerance limit  $ (\Delta V_{T}) $ , for a large number of observations, it will be an equal chance for any one observer accepts (“yes”) or rejects (“no”) it, i.e. 50% will accept and 50% reject it. If the average visual difference  $ (\Delta V) $  for a sample against its standard is less than  $ \Delta V_{T} $ , the  $ P\% $  should be less than 50%, i.e. a minority of observers can still distinguish the differences which less than the tolerance limit  $ \Delta V_{T} $ . The greater the average visual difference  $ \Delta V $  comparing with  $ \Delta V_{T} $  is, the larger the  $ P\% $  will be and vice versa. The scaling problem is to quantify the relationship between  $ \Delta V $  (or more exactly  $ \Delta V - \Delta V_{T} $ ) and  $ P\% $ . As Coates et al. previously studied [18], the perceptible percentage  $ P\% $  values could be transformed to z-score values (standard normal deviates) as an interval scale assuming a normal distribution. For the perceptible percentage  $ (P\%) $  50%, the z-score will be equal to zero, i.e.  $ \Delta V = \Delta V_{T} $ . The lesser the perceptible percentage  $ (P\%) $  is, the smaller the z-score will be. For example, for  $ P\% = 30\% $ ,  $ \Delta V $  is less than  $ \Delta V_{T} $  and  $ \Delta V - \Delta V_{T} $  (or z-score) equals -0.52, and the units of z-score are best considered to be arbitrary. This method of scaling assumes that all of the observers work on the same tolerance limit  $ (\Delta V_{T}) $ . Coates et al [19] showed that the method is satisfactory because the adjusted results only show slight deviations from linearity in plots of  $ \Delta V - \Delta V_{T} $ .

McDonald [20] mentioned that the relationship between colour difference and z-score is near linear only in the range of 10% perceptibility and 90% perceptibility. In Fig. 5, the visual results in the form of z-score are plotted against the CIELAB  $ \Delta E^{*}_{ab,10} $  values for the grey centre. The  $ \Delta E^{*}_{ab,10} $  and z-score values are proportional to each other. It should also be noted that, even for a perfect equation, there would be some scatter on the graph because of experimental variability in both the measured tristimulus values of the samples and the visual assessments.

Considering z-score values have a near linear regression with  $ \Delta V $  values if the perceptibility values outside the range of 10% to 90% are ignored, and their units are considered to be arbitrary, hence, z-score values may be converted to  $ \Delta V $  values using a linear transformation of CIELAB or CIEDE2000 [21, 22] as an arbitrary off-set. No matter which formula is used for scaling the visual colour-differences ( $ \Delta V $ ), only the magnitudes of each pair will be different. However, approximately all the internal relationship between all pairs will not be affected. When they are used to test different formulae and spaces, the performance will not be affected.

As mentioned above, the unit of z-score may be considered to be arbitrary. Hence, one choice of scaling the visual difference is directly using positive z-score by adding an arbitrary off-set to the raw z-score values. In order to transform the negative z-score values into positive and to avoid introducing systematic errors into STRESS, a unique value was chosen in such a way that the minimum value of the z-score was first subtracted from the raw of the z-score dataset to obtain a set of positive z-score, and then an intercept was added to satisfy the ratio condition  $ \Delta E = f \Delta V $  (for minimising the systematic errors in using STRESS). Finally a new set of positive z-score values can be obtained and regarded as the final visual colour differences ( $ \Delta V $ ) in an arbitrary unit.

## Testing Colour-Difference Formulae

Ten colour-difference formulae coming from four families (CIELAB, CIECAM02, OSA and DIN99) were tested with respect to their performance in predicting the threshold colour differences on printed samples surrounding the 17 CIE colour centres. The CIELAB family includes 3 colour-difference formulae: CMC [23], CIE94 [24] and CIEDE2000 [21, 22] together with CIELAB colour space itself. The other

families are approaches to uniform colour spaces. The CIECAM02 family included CAM02-LCD, CAM02-SCD and CAM02-UCS [25]. The OSA family includes OSA-Gp-Eu [26] and OSA colour space [3]. Final family was just the DIN99d [27] colour space.

The performance of the ten colour-difference formulae, in terms of STRESS values  $ [12] $  are shown in Table 3, with the best performance in each case printed in bold font and the worst printed in underline for ease of comparison. Last row in Table 3 shows STRESS values considering all our 893 colour pairs together as one dataset. Obviously these global STRESS values for each colour-difference formula are not the average of the STRESS values at the 17 centres, which are given in the previous row of Table 3.

It can be seen from Table 3 that all the formulae except CIELAB performed very similar with each other, while CIELAB performed the worst for the combined data. It is strange to find out that CIEDE2000 performed not well enough for the "Blue-green, high chroma", and "Blue" centres, and even it was the worst tested formulae for the "Blue, high chroma" centre. These results were in somewhat accord with our experiments carried out by the small colour difference with the grey scale method [28]. This was probably caused by the substrate used in our study [28] which was semi-gloss paper, while the materials of the four datasets used to derive the CIEDE2000 formula were glossy paints and textiles. Note also that, excluding CIELAB, the "Total" STRESS values in Table 3 for the different colour-difference formulae tested are in the range 43.3-56.4 while for the COM-Weighted dataset employed at CIEDE2000 development these values were considerably lower: 27.5-30.6 (see Table 4 in the reference [13]). Anyway the worse performance of most recent colour-difference formulae for very small colour differences, including the last

CIE recommended formula, CIEDE2000, has been also addressed in previous papers  $ [5-7] $ .

Table 4 lists the F-test results using the current experimental data. The bold values in Table 4 indicate a significant difference between the two formulae located in the corresponding rows and columns. It can be seen from Table 4 that the CIELAB colour-difference formula performed significantly worse than the others, and there was no significant difference amongst others.

All the formulae were also tested using the optimised  $ k_{L} $  (lightness parametric factor) values leading to the smallest STRESS values between the computed and perceived colour differences. Table 5 lists the results using the total data for the 17 CIE centres (i.e. 893 colour pairs). The significance of difference between the original formula and its optimised form was also tested using the F-test and the results are given in last row of Table 5. The bold value in Table 5 for CIELAB indicates a significant improvement for this colour-difference formula after  $ k_{L} $  optimisation, while for all the remaining formulae it was found a non-significant improvement.

## Comparison with another Study

The experimental data for each colour centre were used to fit an ellipsoid in CIELAB, CAM02-SCD [25], CAM02-UCS [25], CAM02-LCD [25], DIN99d [27], OSA [3] and OSA-Gp-Eu [26] colour spaces. An ellipsoid equation in the CIELAB space is given in Eq. (9), and similar equations can be used for ellipsoids in other colour spaces.

 $$ \Delta E^{2}=g_{11}\Delta a^{*}{}_{10}{}^{2}+2g_{12}\Delta a^{*}{}_{10}\Delta b^{*}{}_{10}+g_{22}\Delta b^{*}{}_{10}{}^{2}+g_{33}\Delta L^{*}{}_{10}{}^{2} $$ 

where  $ g_{ij} $  are the ellipsoid coefficients, which were optimised to give the smallest STRESS value between the  $ \Delta E $  in Eq. (9) and  $ \Delta V $  values from the experimental data. When fitting these ellipsoids, the scaling factor f in calculating

STRESS was set to one to make the computed  $ \Delta E $  using Eq. (9) to have the same scale as  $ \Delta V $ .

The cross terms for  $ \Delta a^{*}_{10}-\Delta L^{*}_{10} $  and  $ \Delta b^{*}_{10}-\Delta L^{*}_{10} $  had insignificant contribution to the overall colour difference [29, 30], and therefore these terms were excluded in Eq. (9). By removing the  $ g_{33} $  term in Eq. (9), an ellipse equation is also formed. The parameters for each ellipse, in terms of major semi-axis (A), ratio of semi-axes (A/B), orientation angle ( $ \theta $ ) of the major semi-axis (A) with respect to the  $ a^{*}_{10} $  axis, and ellipse size ( $ S=\pi AB $ ), are given in Table 6 for CIELAB.

According to the Monte Carlo testing method [31], all the ellipses fitted corresponding to the 17 colour centres were reliable in the present study. The ellipses obtained from current study were compared with those from previous study [28], in which small colour differences and a grey-scale psychophysical method were applied. Only chromatic ellipses were compared because there were no colour difference pairs in  $ \Delta L^{*}_{10} $  direction in the earlier dataset, so that Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the  $ a^{*}_{10}b^{*}_{10} $  ellipses at the 17 CIE colour centres from these two studies: threshold colour difference (TCD) and small colour difference (SCD) [28]. The semi-axes of the ellipses in Fig. 6 were enlarged 3 times for easier viewing.

In order to test the similitude of the ellipses obtained from different magnitudes of colour differences (TCD and SCD ellipses), 500 randomly distributed sets of  $ \Delta a^{*}_{10} $  and  $ \Delta b^{*}_{10} $  values (with  $ \Delta L^{*}_{10}=0 $ ) were generated around each colour centre [32], and two sets of colour differences were computed using the coefficients of the two ellipses equations shown in Eq. (9). Then the STRESS values between these two sets of computed colour differences can be used to estimate the consistency of the two ellipses, the results being listed in Table 7, the ellipses centres in TCD and SCD studies are the ones given in Table 1.

It can be seen from Fig. 6 and Table 7 that the shape and orientation of ellipses from the current study (TCD) were very close to those from different psychophysical method and different magnitude, except at the purple colour centre (#16). The average difference between two sets of ellipses was low: 14.4 STRESS units comparing with typical 19.7 STRESS values for evaluating SCD datasets [28]. It is important to bear in mind that the small value of 14.4 STRESS units is attributable to both the influences of different magnitudes and psychophysical methods. Anyway this similitude in current results cannot be extrapolated, because in general both the experimental methodology and the magnitude of color differences may strongly influence other colour discrimination results. [33]

## Local and Global Uniformity of Colour Spaces

Fig. 7 shows the chromaticity ellipses fitted to current experimental data at the 17 colour centres in six uniform colour spaces. The semi-axes of all these ellipses were enlarged 3 times, except for OSA space.

Similar to the previous study [28], the uniformity of a space was measured by local uniformity (or ellipticity of ellipses) and global uniformity (or unevenness of ellipses). The local uniformity (or ellipticity) is a measure of deviation from perfect circular form. It may be estimated by calculating RMS (root-mean-square) between the semi-axes ratios of ellipses and circles  $ (A/B = 1) $ , i.e.  $ RMS = \sqrt{\sum[(A/B)_i - 1]^2 / N} $  where N is the number of ellipses tested in a colour space. The global uniformity (or unevenness of ellipses) is a measure of non-uniformity or inconsistency of ellipse-size and may be measured by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV%) of the areas  $ S_i $  of the ellipses in a given space from the equation

 $ CV\% = 100\left[\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(S_{i}-\bar{S}\right)^{2}/N}\right]/\bar{S} $ ，where  $ \bar{S} $  is the average of the  $ S_{i} $  (i=1,...,N) ellipses areas, and N is the number of ellipses. For an ideal uniform colour space, the ellipticity and unevenness of ellipses will equal to zero.

Table 8 lists the results of comparison. It can be seen that CIELAB space performed obviously worse than the others, in both the ellipticity and unevenness of its ellipses. Amongst the seven tested spaces, OSA-Gp-Eu [26] showed the roundest ellipses but the ellipse-size were not consistent in different positions, and DIN99d [27] presented the most consistent size and the second roundest ellipses. The two spaces CAM02-SCD [25], CAM02-UCS [25] based on the extension of CIECAM02 performed reasonable well in both ellipticity and unevenness of ellipses. The results were very similar to those found in small colour difference (SCD) experiment [28].

## CONCLUSIONS

A threshold experiment was conducted to investigate the performance of ten colour-difference formulae and uniform colour spaces. In total, 893 pairs of printed colours were prepared with an average  $ \Delta E^{*}_{ab,10} $  of 1.1 units. Each pair was assessed 48 times by a panel of 16 observers who had normal colour vision. The results showed that all formulae and spaces, except CIELAB, performed very similar with each other, and outperformed CIELAB for threshold colour difference. Comparing the results found with a small colour difference dataset (SCD) [28], the shape and orientation of ellipses from the current study (TCD) were very close to those in SCD, besides using different psychophysical method in addition to different magnitude of colour differences. With regard to the TCD chromaticity ellipses in different colour spaces, it was found that the lowest uniformity appeared at CIELAB colour space.
