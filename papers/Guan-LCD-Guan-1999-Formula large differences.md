Abstract: An experiment was carried out to study large colour differences. Two-hundred-and-ninety-two wool pairs were prepared with an average difference of 12 CIELAB  $ \Delta E $  units. Visual assessments were conducted using gray scale and pair comparison psychophysical methods by a panel of 20 observers. The results from the two psychophysical methods were used to test colour-difference formulae and compare their differences. The gray scale results were also used to compare with the other large colour-difference data sets, i.e., BFB, OSA, and WW. The present results together with part of the other data sets were combined to form a single data set. A modified CIELAB colour-difference formula was developed having a structure similar to that of CIE94. It is named the GLAB colour-difference formula. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

## I NTRODUCTION

Earlier colour-difference studies were mainly based upon small colour differences. This is mainly due to the majority of surface colour industries dealing with small colour differences. Only a few sets were produced with large colour differences, i.e., BFB, $ ^{1} $  OSA, $ ^{2} $  and WW. $ ^{3} $  In fact, large colour-difference applications are also important in colour image reproduction and industrial design. The typical size of colour difference in these industries could be over 10 CIELAB units. Luo et al. $ ^{4} $  found that these three earlier data sets disagree with each other in many aspects. This led to a particular colour-difference formula giving the best prediction to one set of results, but not to the others. Hence, a major part of this study used sample pairs with large colour differences intended to check this situation.

The pair comparison and gray scale psychophysical methods have been widely used to scale the colour difference. The important data sets such as Luo and Rigg data $ ^{5,6} $  and RIT–DuPont $ ^{7,8} $  were used to derive the most advanced colour-difference formulae such as CMC, $ ^{9} $  BFD, $ ^{5,6} $  and CIE94. $ ^{10} $  From the authors' earlier study, $ ^{11} $  the results showed little difference between these two psychophysical methods when used for assessing small colour differences. This study also investigated this using the large colour differences.

## EXPERIMENT

Two-hundred-and-ninety-two sample pairs were dyed using acid dyes on wool. All sample pairs had a fairly large colour difference, i.e., an average of 12 CIELAB  $ \Delta E $  units. Visual assessments were conducted under a set of reference viewing conditions, $ ^{12} $  close to that recommended by the CIE TC 1-28 on parameters affecting colour-difference evaluation. This was achieved using a VeriVide viewing cabinet with a D65 simulator and a neutral gray background with  $ L^{*} $  of 56. Two psychophysical methods were employed: gray scale and pair comparison. For each method, each pair was assessed 2 times by each of the 10 observers. The observers were mainly students and staff at the Colour & Imaging Institute, University of Derby. All observers had normal colour vision according to the Ishihara test. All of them had some experience in scaling colour differences. Each sample had a physical size of a 3-inch square and was measured using a Macbeth MS2020 $ ^{+} $ spectrophotometer. The colorimetric values were then calculated under the CIE D65 Illuminant and 1964 colorimetric standard observer.

gram. Initially, about 300 wool samples were prepared, from which 152 samples were chosen having  $ L^{*} $  values of 40, 50, and 60. These were used to form 292 sample pairs used in the experiment, of which 202 of them had a similar lightness ( $ L^{*} = 50 $ ). This particular arrangement of samples was chosen, because it was capable of forming colour-difference pairs not only in the  $ \Delta a^{*} $  and  $ \Delta b^{*} $  directions (thick vectors in Fig. 1) but also in the directions of mixed  $ \Delta a^{*}\Delta b^{*} $  (i.e., thin vectors in Fig. 1). For each sample located not in the boundary, there are 8 neighboring samples. Hence, a maximum of 8 chromatic pairs could be formed for each colour center. The other 90 sample pairs had mainly lightness differences, which were formed by using batch samples having either  $ L^{*} $  of 40 or 60 against standard samples with  $ L^{*} $  of 50. As shown in Fig. 1, the sample pairs were selected corresponding to roughly 10 units along the  $ a^{*} $  and  $ b^{*} $  directions, and 14 units for  $ \pm45^{\circ} $  directions. The actual colour differences were ranged from 6–21 CIELAB  $ \Delta E $  units with an average of 12 CIELAB  $ \Delta E $  units.

All pairs were used in the gray scale experiment. For the pair comparison experiment, only 201 sample pairs were used, half of the pairs with mainly  $ \Delta L^{*} $  and the  $ \Delta a^{*}\Delta b^{*} $  ( $ \pm45^{\circ} $ ) directions were omitted. It was considered that 201 pairs were sufficient to reveal any difference between two psychophysical methods.

A set of neutral samples were also prepared to form the gray scale having the same physical size and material as the sample pairs being assessed. Their CIELAB colorimetric values together with  $ \Delta E $  and  $ \Delta L^{*} $  values are given in Table I. The "standard" and Grade 1–5 samples were prepared in the earlier study $ ^{[1]} $  for studying the parametric effect of small colour differences, but remeasured for this study. Since some pairs used in the present experiment showed larger perceived differences than the pair formed by "standard" and Grade 1, i.e., the largest difference in the gray scale, three additional neutral samples were added to the original gray scale. These form three new pairs against the "standard" sample. All had CIELAB  $ \Delta E $  values above 20. The measured differences increase from Grade 5 to Grade

−0.5. As shown in Table I, the  $ \Delta L^{*} $  values agree almost exactly with the CIELAB  $ \Delta E $  values. This indicated that all the differences were essentially lightness differences. The gray scale method used was the same as that used by the authors' other study, $ ^{[11]} $  except by adding three new samples to the gray scale.

For experiments conducted using the pair comparison method, it was found that, for some pairs, observers gave unanimously smaller or larger colour difference than that of the standard pair. It was decided to use three standard pairs in the pair comparison experiment. The samples for these pairs were also chosen from the gray scale, i.e., Grades 1, 2, 3, and 5, in which Grade 1 was used as the "standard" of each pair. The three standard pairs used in the pair comparison experiment were formed from the gray scale samples. There are three standard pairs, named "small," "moderate," and "large," which were formed by Grade 1 against Grades 2, 3, and 5, having CIELAB  $ \Delta E $  values of 6.0, 9.3, and 12, respectively. The visual colour differences of the majority of the experimental pairs were within the colour differences between the "large" and "small" standard pairs. The arrangement of sample pairs are shown in Fig. 2. A sample pair plus three standard pairs were shown to each observer simultaneously. They were asked to judge whether the colour difference of the sample pair is larger or smaller than those of each of the three standard pairs.

## DATA ANALYSIS

Many comparisons were made between two sets of data, such as comparing the visual results and the calculated colour difference ( $ \Delta E $ ) from a particular colour-difference formula. The Performance Factor (PF/3) described in an earlier article was used. $ ^{[11]} $  This measure is given in Eq. (1). For perfect agreement between two sets of data, the PF/3 should equal zero. A higher PF/3 value indicates a worse agreement between data sets. A PF/3 value of 30 indicates a typical disagreement between two sets of data of about 30%.

 $$  PF/3=100[(\gamma-1)+V_{AB}+CV/100]/3. $$ 

For the gray scale experimental results, the raw data in Grades (G) were converted to the visual difference ( $ \Delta V_{gs} $ ) using Eq. (2) for each pair i.

 $$ \begin{aligned}\Delta Vgs_{i}=31.227&-25.392G_{i}\\&+9.013G_{i}^{2}-1.495G_{i}^{3}+0.092G_{i}^{4}.\end{aligned} $$ 

The coefficients in Eq. (2) were obtained by optimizing between the CIELAB  $ \Delta E $  and Grade values for all sample pairs in the gray scale (see Table I). The arithmetic mean of  $ \Delta V_{gs} $  values for each pair was calculated and used for the subsequent analysis.

The visual results from the pair comparison experiment were presented in terms of visual probability  $ (P) $ , i.e., the probability that the colour difference of a sample pair is judged larger than that of standard pair. The method described in an earlier article $ ^{11} $  was again used to transform the P value to visual colour difference  $ (\Delta Vpc) $  using Eq. (3).

 $$ \Delta V p c_{i}=\alpha-\ln[(1/P_{i})-1], $$ 

where $\Delta Vpc_{i}$ is the visual colour difference value for pair $i$, and the $\alpha$ value was optimized until the PF/3 measure of the $\Delta Vpc$ and gray scale results ($\Delta Vgs$) reached a minimum. In other words, the $\alpha$ value is treated as a scaling factor to adjust the $\Delta Vpc$ values on to the same scale as those of the $\Delta Vgs$ values.

 $ ^{a} $  Probabilities of 1 and 0 means that all observers judged the colour difference of the sample pair larger and smaller than that of the standard pair, respectively.

## OBSERVER VARIATION

In both the gray scale experiments, each pair was assessed by a panel of 10 observers. Each observer did the visual assessments twice. Hence, 20 observations were accumulated for each pair. The observer accuracy in this study is represented by the average deviation between the individual and mean visual results, using the PF/3 measure. The typical observation accuracy was 27 PF/3 units ranging from 19–38 units. This corresponds to a typical error of about 6%  $ (27/(20)^{1/2}) $ . This degree of accuracy was considered to be quite good in comparison with the earlier study $ ^{11} $  with a PF/3 of 40. This is mainly because more experienced observers were used in the present study and higher accuracy results are expected when assessing large rather than small colour-difference pairs (at least when expressing the accuracy as a percentage).

The observer repeatability performance was also studied by calculating the PF/3 measure between each observer's first and second assessments. It was found that the typical observer repeatability was 18 PF/3 units varying from 15–23. This performance is expected, i.e., better than the observer accuracy (27 PF/3 units). In general, each observer's results are quite repeatable.

## COMPARING GRAY SCALE AND PAIR COMPARISON RESULTS

One of the goals in this study is to investigate whether same sample pairs assessed using the gray scale and pair comparison methods would give the same visual results. As mentioned earlier, the visual probability  $ (P) $  from the pair comparison results was transformed to visual difference  $ (\Delta Vpc) $  using Eq. (3), which has the same magnitude as the  $ \Delta Vgs $  obtained from the gray scale results. For the pair comparison results obtained in this study, three standard pairs were used. As demonstrated by the authors' earlier study, $ ^{[11]} $  the key factor for making a successful pair comparison experiment is to prepare sample pairs carefully having colour differences close to that of the standard pair. Otherwise, many pairs will be consistently judged as having smaller or larger colour differences than that of the standard pair, i.e., have a probability of 0 or 1. These pairs have little use for data analysis. The sample pairs prepared in this study covered a large range (6–21 CIELAB  $ \Delta E $  units). Hence, it was decided to use three standard pairs to cover the full range of colour differences studied. The number of sample pairs with probability of 0 or 1 against each of the three standard pairs is given in Table II.

The results show that there are 46%, 14%, and 26% of pairs having probabilities of either 0 or 1. In other words, for only one standard pair, say MOD, 14% of the visual data cannot be used. However, useful data can still be obtained for most of these pairs using the results obtained with the other two standard pairs.

The optimized  $ \alpha $  values in Eq. (3) were 7.8, 10.8, and 13.2 for the SMA, MOD, and LAR standard pairs, respectively. For each sample pair, these  $ \alpha $  values were used to calculate three  $ \Delta V_{pc} $  values corresponding to each of the three standard pairs. Finally, one of the three  $ \Delta V_{pc} $  values was chosen to represent the result for this pair. The one chosen was the one for which the probability was closest to the 0.5. For some pairs, the probabilities of two standard pairs were equally close to 0.5, and the mean of the two  $ \Delta V_{pc} $  values was used. This method enables the results from almost all pairs to be used in the following study. Only two pairs, which had probabilities of 0 against all three standard pairs, could not be used in this study.

The  $ \Delta Vpc $  results are plotted against the  $ \Delta Vgs $  results in Fig. 3. The agreement is considered to be very reasonable with a PF/3 value of 12. The trend of data scattering in Fig. 3 is in excellent agreement to that of the previous study $ ^{[1]} $  using small colour differences, i.e., a weak curvature relationship, but the majority of data points are located fairly close to the  $ 45^{\circ} $  line. Thus, two completely different psychophysical methods give very similar answers regardless of the magnitudes of colour differences studied.

## TESTING COLOUR-DIFFERENCE FORMULAE

colour differences, i.e., quite different  $ \Delta E $  values could be obtained by exchanging the two samples of a pair as "standard." This is caused by only using the  $ L^{*} $ ,  $ C^{*} $ , and hue angle of the "standard" to calculate the weighting function for each colour-difference component, i.e.,  $ S_{L} $ ,  $ S_{C} $ ,  $ S_{H} $ . When a large colour difference occurs between standard and batch samples, the values of these weighting functions are quite different, depending on which sample is used as "standard." In the present study, the geometric mean of the two samples in each pair was used for determining the weighting functions, instead of using the value of the "standard," i.e., using  $ (C_{s}^{*}C_{b}^{*})^{1/2} $  to calculate  $ S_{C} $  function in the CMC formula, instead of  $ C_{s}^{*} $ , where subscripts s and b represent the standard and batch in a sample pair. For the CIE94 formula, the geometric mean already suggested by CIE $ ^{10} $  was used for calculating its  $ S_{C} $  function.

<div style="text-align: center;">FIG. 5. Predicted  $ \Delta E $  values calculated from individual colour-difference formulae using the optimized  $ K_{L} $  values plotted against the visual colour differences ( $ \Delta V $ ).</div>


The performance of the four colour-difference formulae tested using the gray scale experimental results are summarized in Table III in terms of the PF/3 measure [see Eq. (1)]. The results show that CIE94 performs the best (22 PF/3 units), followed by CMC, CIELAB, with BFD the worst (29). This finding is also verified by their scatter diagrams as shown in Figs. 4(a)–(d), in which the  $ \Delta E $  values calculated from the CIELAB, CMC, BFD, and CIE94 ( $ K_{L} = 1 $ ) are plotted against the visual results ( $ \Delta V $ ). Another study carried out by Pointer and Attridge $ ^{13} $  showed the similar conclusion, i.e., CIE94 performed better than CMC and CIELAB, although they did not mention whether the mean  $ L^{*} $ ,  $ C^{*} $ , and h values for the standard and batch in each pair were used to calculate the CMC's  $ S_{L} $ ,  $ S_{C} $ , and  $ S_{H} $  weighting factors.

The  $ K_{L} $  value for each formula was also optimized to give the best PF/3 measure between the  $ \Delta V $  and  $ \Delta E $  values. The results given in Table III show that their performance becomes very similar, and all formulae improve their predictive accuracy. The CIELAB formula gives the most accurate prediction (18 PF/3 units), and the other three formulae give almost the same performance (around 21). However, the  $ K_{L} $  values are quite different for different formulae, i.e., 0.65, 0.80, 0.66, and 1.11 for CIELAB, CMC, BFD, and CIE94, respectively. This indicates that the relationship between the lightness and chromatic differences for each formula is quite different. It was also found that each formula's  $ K_{L} $  values for evaluating large colour differences are about 40% lower than those found in the previous study $ ^{[1]} $  using small colour differences. This suggests that, for evaluating large colour differences, lightness differences are consistently judged larger relative to chroma or hue differences. Figures 5(a)–(d) are the plots for CIELAB, CMC, BFD, and CIE94 with optimized  $ K_{L} $ , respectively. It can be clearly seen that

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl//79bcdfad-f0b3-494d-a9da-446da750febe/markdown_6/imgs/img_in_chart_box_226_90_1042_903.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2025-12-30T04%3A23%3A25Z%2F-1%2F%2F7c168f6d87e7d6bb0b9bfb9dfb867cd1b62faf1f1cdb9762c36e2a84c5b0e22e" alt="Image" width="66%" /></div>

the scatter for each formula in Fig. 5 is less than that in Fig. 4, especially for CIELAB and BFD formulae.

The  $ \Delta V_{pc} $  results were also used to test the performance of four colour-difference formulae. The results are also given in Table III. It can be found that the PF/3 and  $ K_{L} $  values for each formula from the pair comparison experiment are almost identical to those of the gray scale experiment. This again confirms that the visual results obtained from the gray scale and pair comparison psychophysical methods are almost the same.

## COMPARING WITH THE BFB DATA

The BFB data was compared with the present gray scale results. This data was accumulated by Badu and Rigg $ ^{1} $  at University of Bradford. It is the only large colour-difference data set produced in a similar fashion to the present study, i.e., many of the sample pairs used textile material, and all pairs were assessed by a panel of 20 observers under a D65 simulator using the gray scale method. The experimental conditions were quite close to those used in the present study. The whole data set consists of 408 sample pairs including 238 nylon and 170 glossy paint sample pairs, which are designated BFBT and BFBP subsets. The BFBT set can be further divided into three groups, including the sample pairs with only lightness differences (FBTBL), only chromatic difference in the  $ L^{*}=50 $  plane (FBBTC), and the mixing lightness with chromatic difference (FBBTM). Figure 6 shows the BFBTC set distributed in  $ a^{*}b^{*} $  diagram. All pairs had an  $ L^{*} $  value of about 50. As can be seen, the sample distributions were different from the present study (see Fig. 1), i.e., the BFBTC sample pairs were located along lines of  $ 30^{\circ} $ ,  $ 90^{\circ} $ , and  $ 150^{\circ} $  against the  $ a^{*} $  axis, as compared to  $ 0^{\circ} $ ,  $ \pm45^{\circ} $ , and  $ 90^{\circ} $  in the present study. Hence, for each colour not located on the boundary, BFBTC had 6 neighboring samples in comparison with 8 samples in the present study.

The experimental visual results for any colour center can be conveniently summarized and compared as chromatic discrimination ellipses. The method used for fitting ellipses

was the same as that used by Luo and Rigg. $ ^{14} $  Twelve colour centers, which covered a large colour area and had similar locations in the  $ a^{*}b^{*} $  diagram for both data sets, were chosen.

both data sets. Both sets of ellipses were judged to be reliable according to the reliability test using the Monte-Carlo method. $ ^{15} $  The  $ L^{*} $ ,  $ a^{*} $ ,  $ b^{*} $  values, semi-major axis (A), ratio of the semi-major and semi-minor axes (A/B), orientation angle ( $ \theta $ ), square root of ellipse area ( $ \sqrt{\pi AB} $ ) for each colour center are given in Table IV together with the ratio, which is calculated by dividing the square root of the ellipse area of the BFBTC data by that of the present data. The ratio indicates the size difference between two data sets.

In comparison with the shapes of ellipses using the A/B values in Table IV, the two sets of results agree well with each other, having a mean variation about 17% with the maximum of 50% for colour center 7. Similarly, there is a small variation in the orientation of two sets of ellipses, i.e., the mean difference is about  $ 8^{\circ} $  with the maximum variation of  $ 25^{\circ} $  for colour center 12. However, this angle difference is not important, since the ellipses are almost round for this colour center. A systematic discrepancy can be found in comparing the sizes of ellipses. The results show the size of the visual difference from the BFBTC data to be, on average, 44% larger than that from the present data. In other words, the perceived colour difference of a sample pair would be judged 44% smaller by their observers than by the observers used in the present study. This difference is puzzling, because both sets of data as based on the use of a gray scale for the visual assessments.

Figure 7 shows the two sets of chromatic ellipses plotted in  $ a^{*}b^{*} $  diagram. It shows quite clearly that the BFBTC ellipses (plotted using a dashed line) are larger than those (full line) from the present data, but the orientations and shapes of ellipses between the two sets are very similar.

quantify the variation between the two sets of ellipses. For each center, the  $ V_{AB} $  value was calculated from the two different ellipse equations using 500 randomly generated pairs. The first analysis was conducted to compare two sets of  $ \Delta E $  values calculated from the two ellipse equations with equal size of ellipse, i.e., by adjusting each of the BFBTC ellipses to have the same size as that of the present data. The results show a mean  $ V_{AB} $  value of 0.06 with a maximum of 0.13. The second analysis was conducted to compare two sets of  $ \Delta E $  values with the original sizes of ellipses without any adjustment. The results show a mean  $ V_{AB} $  value of 0.37 with a maximum of 0.51. The final analysis was to adjust all BFBTC ellipses by a factor of 1.44, which is the mean size variation found in Table IV. The results show a mean  $ V_{AB} $  value of 0.11 with a maximum of 0.16. This implies a very good agreement discounting the size of ellipses, i.e., 6%. The mean variation increases to about 37% when the two sets of original ellipses are compared. This again suggests that there is a large discrepancy in ellipse sizes between the two sets of data. When adjusting all BFBTC ellipse sizes by a factor of 1.44, the ellipse variation reduces to about 11%.

In conclusion, there is very good agreement between the present and BFBTC data in all respects, except in ellipse sizes, i.e., the BFBTC ellipses are consistently larger than the present ellipses.

It is also desirable to compare the results for the lightness pairs in two data sets. There is difficulty in directly comparing the two sets of lightness results, i.e., there are no lightness difference pairs used in both studies having the same  $ a^{*}b^{*} $  coordinates, and the current lightness pairs have a quite limited range (including one sample in a pair having  $ L^{*} $  of 50 and the other sample with  $ L^{*} $  of either 40 or 60). In addition, it is interesting to see whether the chromatic pairs used in both studies will give similar performance from 4 colour-difference formulae. It was decided to test the colour-difference formulae using 4 subsets according to whether the sets involved the lightness or chromatic differences. They are present lightness (GL), present chromatic (GC), FBFT lightness (FBFTL), and FBFT chromatic (FBFTC) data, which have 90, 202, 88, and 130 pairs, respectively.

The CIELAB, CMC, BFD, and CIE94 formulae were again tested using these 4 sets of data in terms of the PF/3 measure. The results are given in Table V. Only the original formulae (i.e., with  $ K_{L}=1 $ ) were used. There is no need to optimize the  $ K_{L} $  in this test, since lightness and chromatic pairs were separated. Comparing the performance between formulae in predicting the two lightness data sets (FBTBL and GL), all formulae gave almost the same performance for the GL data, but the CMC and BFD formulae performed much better than CIELAB and CIE94 (both formulae use the  $ L^{*} $  scale) for the FBTBL data. As mentioned earlier, two lightness difference data sets had quite different lightness ranges (FBTBL data includes a much wider range than the GL data set). The results clearly show that the CIELAB  $ L^{*} $  scale does not fit the FBTBL data. Comparing the performance between formulae to predict chromatic colour-difference data (FBBTC and GC), all formulae except CIELAB gave a similar performance, i.e., CIELAB fitted the best to GC set, but the worst to FBBTC set. This implies that there are still some differences between the two data sets.

## TESTING COLOUR-DIFFERENCE FORMULAE USING AVAILABLE LARGE COLOUR-DIFFERENCE DATA SETS

Four large colour-difference data sets were accumulated: BFB, $ ^{1} $  Optical Society of America (OSA), $ ^{2} $  Wright and Wyszecki (WW), $ ^{3} $  together with the present gray scale results (G). These were used to evaluate the performance of the CIELAB, CMC, BFD, and CIE94 colour-difference formulae in terms of the PF/3 measure. The results are given in Table VI.

Comparing the four original colour-difference formulae, i.e.,  $ K_{L} = K_{C} = K_{H} = 1 $ , CIE94 gave the best prediction (25), followed by CMC and BFD, with CIELAB (30) the worst. Comparing the four colour-difference formulae with optimized  $ k_{L} $ , there is hardly any difference between the 4 colour-difference formulae tested, i.e., PF/3 values vary only from 24–26. All formulae except for CIE94 show that there is a need to use a lower  $ K_{L} $  value (or more significant perceived lightness difference) for evaluating the large colour differences than small colour differences. It is difficult to draw any conclusion as to which formula is superior to the others. For example, CIELAB performs the best for WW and G data, but the worst for BFB data. BFD performs the best for the BFB data, but not so well for the other data sets. This indicates that there are significant discrepancies between these four data sets. These discrepancies may be caused by the different experimental techniques, textures of samples, and viewing conditions used in the experiments.

Also, the performance of each formula is considerably affected by applying different lightness weighting factors. Except for the WW data, the optimum  $ K_{L} $  values for each formula are quite consistent across the other three data sets.

## MODIFICATION TO CIELAB COLOUR-DIFFERENCE FORMULA

The CIE TC 1-29 committee on Industrial Colour Difference Evaluation proposed a generic colour-difference formula for evaluating parametric effects. $ ^{[10]} $  It is based upon CIELAB given in Eq. (4) incorporated the lightness, chroma, and hue weighting functions and parametric coefficients. It was suggested that, for visual assessment conducted under the reference conditions, the parametric coefficients,  $ K_{L} $ ,  $ K_{C} $ , and  $ K_{H} $ , should set to 1.

 $$ \Delta E=\left[\left(\frac{\Delta L^{*}}{K_{L}S_{L}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\Delta C^{*}}{K_{C}S_{C}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\Delta H^{*}}{K_{H}S_{H}}\right)^{2}\right]^{1/2}, $$ 

where  $ S_{L} $ ,  $ S_{C} $ , and  $ S_{H} $  are the weighting functions representing the lengths of the ellipsoid semi-axes in CIELAB colour space. This structure is also used in the CMC formula. The weighting functions allow adjustment of their respective components according to the location of the standard in CIELAB colour space. The CIE94 formula uses the weights of  $ S_{L}=1 $ ,  $ S_{C}=1+0.045C_{sb}^{*} $ , and  $ S_{H}=1+0.015C_{sb}^{*} $ , where  $ C_{sb}^{*} $  is the geometric mean of the two samples in question.

As described earlier, for some formulae, quite different  $ \Delta E $  values can be obtained when exchanging two samples as "standard," for evaluating large colour-difference pairs. The lightness, chroma, and hue weighting functions should be calculated using either the arithmetic mean (as in BFD) or geometric mean (as here in CMC and CIE94). The latter was used to derive a new formula for evaluating large colour-difference pairs. The general strategy is to gather a combined data set and then to develop a new formula that is a modification to the CIELAB formula with weighting functions similar to CIE94 using simple linear equations.

Four (WW, OSA, BFB, and G) data sets having large-size colour differences were used for deriving the weighting functions in Eq. (4). Four methods were used and are summarized in Table VII, where  $ L_{sb} $  and  $ C_{sb} $  are the  $ L^{*} $  and  $ C^{*} $  values of geometrical mean calculated between two samples in a pair, respectively.  $ W_{L} $ ,  $ W_{C} $ , and  $ W_{H} $  are the coefficients to be optimized. In Method 1, the three weighting functions are all equal to one, i.e., the original CIELAB formula. In Method 2, the  $ S_{L} $  value is set to be a constant by minimizing the PF/3 measure with  $ S_{C} = S_{H} = 1.0 $ . In Methods 4 and 3, the  $ S_{L} $  (constant),  $ W_{C} $  and  $ W_{H} $ , and  $ W_{L} $ ,  $ W_{C} $ , and  $ W_{H} $ , respectively, are again optimized. The optimized coefficients and PF/3 measures for each data/method are given in Table VIII.

The results show that Method 2 performed considerably better than Method 1 for all data sets, except that only a slightly better performance was found for the WW data. In addition, the  $ S_{L} $  weighting factors in Method 2 are quite low, about 0.62, for all data sets except WW (0.97). Methods 3 and 4 gave consistently better predictions than the other methods.

The optimized  $ W_{C} $  and  $ W_{H} $  coefficients from Method 4 for each data set are quite different. For WW data,  $ W_{C} $  and  $ W_{H} $  are almost zero. For BFB data,  $ W_{C} $  and  $ W_{H} $  are 0.04 and 0.01, respectively, which are much higher than those for OSA and the G data. All optimized constants and coefficients from OSA and the G data set are in good agreement. This indicates a great similarity between these two data sets.

It was decided to further investigate the BFB data, because it includes different subsets for investigating different aspects of colour differences. The BFBT, BFBP, and BFBTC were again used here for deriving new formulae. Methods 3 and 4 were again used to investigate these three subsets. The optimized constants and coefficients together with the PF/3 measure for each method are given in Table IX.

The results show that the  $ W_{C} $  and  $ W_{H} $  coefficients for BFBP paint samples subset are quite different from two textile subsets (BFBT and BFBTC). This seems to imply some inconsistency between the BFBT and BFBP data sets. Finally, the BFBT data set was combined with the OSA and the G data sets to form a combined large colour-difference data set, due to the similarity of their  $ S_{L} $ ,  $ W_{C} $ , and  $ W_{H} $  coefficients. However, the results from different data sets have different magnitudes; thus, it is necessary to adjust their sizes onto a common scale. The OSA and BFBT results were adjusted to have the same scale as those of the G data set. There is no direct way to find the scaling factor for each data set except via colour-difference formula. For each individual set, the scaling factors were calculated using a least square method between the visual results ( $ \Delta V $ ) and the predicted  $ \Delta E $  from each of the four original formulae. The average

of these scaling factors from four formulae was used to adjust the visual results in the OSA and BFBT data sets, i.e., 1.38 and 5.14, respectively. Finally, a new combined data set for evaluating large colour differences was formed including 658 pairs.

Again, the  $ S_{L} $ ,  $ S_{C} $ ,  $ S_{H} $  weighting functions in Eq. (4) were optimized when the PF/3 measure reached the minimum. The weighting functions from Methods 3 and 4 were used to test which of them is better based on the combined data. The results showed that Method 4 gave a better fit to the combined data than Method 3. This resulted in a new colour-difference formula, named GLAB, given in Eq. (5).

 $$ \Delta E=\left[\left(\frac{\Delta L^{*}}{K_{L}S_{L}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\Delta C^{*}}{K_{C}S_{C}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\Delta H^{*}}{K_{H}S_{H}}\right)^{2}\right]^{1/2}, $$ 

where  $ S_{L}=0.76 $ ,  $ S_{C}=1+0.016C_{sb} $ , and  $ S_{H}=1 $ , and  $ C_{sb}=(C_{Std}^{*}\ C_{Bat}^{*})^{1/2} $ . For the reference viewing conditions,  $ K_{L} $ ,  $ K_{C} $ , and  $ K_{H} $  equal one.

The performance of the CIELAB, CMC, BFD, CIE94, and newly developed GLAB formulae were tested using the BFBT, BFBP, and full set (BFB), OSA, WW, G, Combined, and GPC data sets. The latter data is the  $ \Delta V_{pc} $  results representing the present pair comparison results. The results are summarized in Table X in terms of PF/3 values.

Comparing the five original colour-difference formulae  $ (K_{L}=K_{C}=K_{H}=1) $ , the GLAB formula performs the best for BFBT, OSA, G, and Combined data sets as expected, because these were used to derive the GLAB formula. The same conclusion can also be found by comparing the five colour-difference formulae with optimized  $ K_{L} $  values. However, a difference of only 4 PF/3 units indicates that GLAB is not very much better than CIE94 (the second best). In addition, BFD (0.65:1) and CIELAB performed the best for the BFB and WW data sets, respectively. This suggests that there are large discrepancies between the existing large colour-difference data sets. Obviously, more research work is required in this area. Finally, comparing the G and GPC data sets,

again, the GLAB formula gave the most accurate prediction. This confirms a great similarity between the present gray scale and pair comparison results.

## CONCLUSION

One objective of this study is to examine the difference between visual results obtained from the two most widely used experimental techniques: gray scale and pair comparison. The results show that there is a good agreement between these methods. The experimental results also show that the gray scale method has an advantage over the pair comparison method, due to the former method being capable of covering a large range of colour-difference magnitudes. For the pair comparison method, there is a need to carefully select sample pairs having similar colour differences to that of the standard pair. However, the method devised here to use three or more standard pairs can improve the shortcoming of the existing method using only one standard pair.

Four advanced colour-difference formulae were tested using the present data; the results show that for gray scale results ( $ \Delta V_{gs} $ ), CIELAB (0.65:1) performed slightly better

than CMC (0.80:1), CIE94 (1.11:1), and BFD (0.66:1) formulae, in which the latter three gave almost identical performance. For testing the same formulae using the pair comparison results ( $ \Delta V_{pc} $ ), the order of merits and the optimized  $ K_{L} $  values for each formula are almost identical to those gray scale results. This further confirms the excellent agreement between the results from two scaling methods. The performance of these formulae is completely reversed from that in the previous study on small colour differences, $ ^{11} $  in which BFD, CMC, and CIE94 formulae markedly outperformed CIELAB. This implies that there is a considerable difference between the large and small colour-difference data sets. All formulae except CIE94 also improve their performance in predicting large colour-difference pairs by the introduction of the lightness weighting factor. It is also encouraging that the weighting factors obtained from the gray scale and pair comparison results were very close. This again supports the earlier findings.

Large differences were found between different large colour-difference data sets. The data sets having similar characteristic were combined to form a single data set including the OSA, the present, and BFBT. The WW set was discarded because of appreciably difference of the optimized weighting constants or coefficients. The BFBP data set also shows very different behaviour in comparison with the BFBT data set. The combined data set was used to derive a new colour-difference formula (GLAB) similar in structure to CIE94. This formula gave the best prediction to the combined data, as expected. However, the improvement is not very large. This formula can be used for evaluating the colour fidelity between different colour reproduction systems and industrial design applications. The magnitude of colour difference in these applications is similar to those studied here.
