Abstract: The formulation of a metric to provide numbers that correlate with visually perceived colour differences has proved a very difficult task. Most early experimental work was concerned with just-perceptible colour differences. Later the concept of perceptibility was expanded to acceptability, it being argued that many industrial tolerances were larger than just-perceptible. This led naturally to the concept of large colour differences and the question as to whether the current CIE colour-difference formulae, specified as appropriate for just-perceptible differences, can be applied to larger differences than those concerned with, for instance, colour matches experienced in the fabric dyeing industry. This article investigates the application of four colour-difference formulae to visual scaling of large colour differences between photographically prepared reflection colour samples at approximately constant lightness. It is shown that the scaling of colour differences depends on the directions of hue and chroma differences of a test sample when compared with a reference. It is also shown that, of the four candidate colour-difference metrics, the modified CIE 1976 L *a* *b* *colour difference, referred to as CIE1994 or ΔE*<sub>94</sub>•, correlates best with visual scaling. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

## I NTRODUCTION

There are obvious reasons why it would be useful to characterize colorimetric colour differences in a way that parallels the human visual perception of colour difference, but the formulation of a metric to provide numbers that correlate well with visually perceived colour differences has proven to be a very difficult task. There are many hundreds of literature references relating to the subject, most of which have been produced during the last 60 years, since the XYZ system of colour specification was recommended by the CIE in 1931. $ ^{1} $  Before this, the only major work on colour-difference evaluation was carried out by Munsell in establishing his Book of Color. $ ^{2} $ 

A useful colour-difference formula must be able to derive a number that correlates with the difference perceived between two colours by observers of normal colour vision. Ideally, it should be capable of working accurately over the entire colour space, under all viewing conditions, and for all types of sample presentation and background. There is much in the literature to establish that this is very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.

Most early work was concerned with ‘‘just-perceptible’’ colour differences. In 1941 Wright published data derived by asking observers to perform a colour match between two photometric fields and then to perturb the colour of one field by a just-perceptible amount. $ ^{3} $  MacAdam had one observer perform many colour-matching experiments: ellipses that represented variations in the observer’s matches were then established in the CIE 1931 x, y chromaticity diagram and published in 1942. $ ^{4} $  Later the concept of perceptibility was expanded to acceptability, it being argued that industrial tolerances in, for example, a dye house might be larger than just-perceptible colour differences. $ ^{5} $ 

The work of Wright and MacAdam established that the 1931 x, y chromaticity diagram was not able to represent chromaticity differences in a uniform manner. This led, and is still leading, to many attempts to derive a uniform

colour space: that is, a colour space in which geometric distances are uniformly proportional to visual differences between pairs of coloured samples. The difficulty of this problem is illustrated by the CIE recommendation, in 1976, of two Uniform Colour Spaces,  $ L^{*}a^{*}b^{*} $  and  $ L^{*}u^{*}v^{*} $  (CIELAB and CIELUV), and associated colour-difference formulae. The CIE gives no clear guidelines as to when either should be used, other than to say that they are intended “to apply to comparisons of differences between object colours of the same size and shape, viewed in identical white to middle-grey surroundings, by an observer photopically adapted to a field of chromaticity not too different from that of average daylight” (see CIE Document 15.2 $ ^{1} $ ). It is also true to say that these formulae, and those from which they were directly descended, have become recognized as applicable to just-perceptible, or threshold, colour differences, whereas their applicability to suprathreshold colour differences has not been proven. $ ^{5,6} $ 

It is of interest that these CIE Uniform Colour Spaces both owe something to the Munsell Book of Color. $ ^{2} $  The origins of the CIELUV Uniform Colour Space can be traced back through work by Eastwood $ ^{7} $  to an early recommendation by MacAdam, $ ^{8} $  while the origins of the CIELAB Uniform Colour Space can be found in the Adams Chromatic Value Diagram, $ ^{9} $  which attempted to regularize the spacing of the samples of the Munsell Book of Color. It can thus be argued that these spaces are not based on just-perceptible difference data at all, but on what are now called “large” colour-difference data, because the spacing of the Munsell samples in, for example, CIELAB space, is usually greater than 4 units. (See, for example, Pointer $ ^{6} $  and Hunt $ ^{10} $ ). In 1980, McDonald published a series of articles $ ^{11-13} $  that described the use of visual pass/fail colour-difference data to establish weighting functions to take account of the variation in lightness difference, chroma difference, and hue difference sensitivity within a CIELAB colour metric. The equation was later refined and became known as the CMC colour-difference formula. $ ^{14} $  In 1995, the CIE recommended a new colour-difference formula for field trial. $ ^{15} $  This formula can be considered an extension of CIELAB and incorporates many of the ideas incorporated into the CMC formula. It is referred to as the CIE1994, or  $ \Delta E_{94}^{*} $ , formula.

It is reasonable and of interest to consider the application of these colour difference formulae to the analysis of large colour differences, with magnitudes typical of those achieved by photographic and other colour reproduction systems, typically in the range of 0–20 CIELAB units. It was considered desirable to conduct an experiment to compare calculated colour differences with the results of visual scaling of such differences by a panel of observers. In this way it was hoped to identify the most useful colour-difference formula, and, hence, the most useful metric,  $ \Delta E^{*} $ , for the characterization of large colour differences.

At least two important practical applications for such a metric are envisaged. The first concerns the differences that exist between the colour of an object in a scene and the colour of that object when reproduced in, for example, a photographic reflection print. The second application is to compare the reproduction of an object colour using one system with that obtained using a different system. Again the range of colour differences between the two systems can be quite large, thus bringing into question the usefulness of the 1976 CIELAB equation. It can be argued that both applications actually require the use of a colour-appearance model to analyze the associated differences. $ ^{10} $  This is because the viewing conditions, for example, the level of illumination and the overall content of the visual field, commonly differ considerably between the original scene and the reproduction, and CIE colorimetry has no facility to take account of differences in these parameters.

Exactly similar arguments can also be applied to the 1976 CIELUV equation, which is also used, although its application is mainly to colours viewed on video display units. $ ^{[16]} $  This latter usage appears to be due to the fact that the CIELUV space has the advantage of an associated chromaticity diagram, which is useful for describing additive colour reproduction systems. The CIELAB colour space has no closely associated chromaticity diagram, because the definition of the space relies on a nonlinear transformation of the CIE 1931 X, Y, Z tristimulus values. In practice, the CIELAB colour space can yield  $ a^{*} $ ,  $ b^{*} $  diagrams, which, at constant  $ L^{*} $ , can be useful in the investigation of colour reproduction systems.

## PREVIOUS WORK

The literature suggests at least three fundamentally different methods for deriving large colour-difference data. The first involves using a magnitude estimation technique to derive numbers relating to the perceived size of the differences, the second relies on multiple pair comparisons, while the third uses a colour-difference matching technique.

As an example of the first method, Kawakami $ ^{17} $  had observers subjectively estimate the colour difference of 90 pairs of real reflection samples using the ratio estimation method. A reference pair, of stipulated colour difference, was shown and the observer assessed the colour difference of a test pair as a ratio of the reference colour difference.

A recent example of the second method is the work by Stalmeier and de Weert, $ ^{18} $  who used a technique of triadic comparisons, where three coloured fields, i, j, and k, were presented in the shape of a triangle on a high-resolution colour monitor. Field k served as a standard, and the observer was required to say which of the fields, i or j, was the more similar to field k. Three sets of colours were used, the first having 10 colours giving 720 triadic combinations; the other two each had 13 colours giving 1716 combinations. The results were analyzed using a

multidimensional scaling technique to compare the mean spacing between the fields with that obtained by applying various colour-difference equations.

The third method, that of colour-difference matching, has been used, for example, by Fuchida et al. $ ^{19} $  Two reference colour fields and one test field were presented on a colour monitor. The observer was asked to adjust the test field until it was perceived as a colour “half-way” between the colours of the given reference fields.

It should be noted that there is little in the literature that specifically relates colour-difference evaluation to the quality of colour reproduction. MacAdam $ ^{20} $  discusses acceptability in terms of the x, y chromaticity diagram. Pitt $ ^{21} $  investigated the application of the CIE 1964  $ U^{*}V^{*}W^{*} $  colour-difference formula to photographic reflection prints and concluded that the formula could predict colour “fidelity”; it was found, however, that a better prediction was obtained by separately weighting the lightness component of the formula. Attridge and Allbright $ ^{22} $  used the CIELUV equation to investigate and quantify large differences between colour-pairs obtained photographically and by computer display. Sayer and Skipper $ ^{23} $  and Wood et al. $ ^{24} $  investigated the perception of colour differences in photographic prints and subsequently evaluated various colour-difference equations. Ohta $ ^{25} $  used values of CIE 1976 colour difference,  $ \Delta E_{ab}^{*} $ , to quantify the effect on colour reproduction of perturbing a number of the components of a subtractive photographic system. Stokes et al. $ ^{26} $  described psychophysical experiments based on images manipulated in CIELAB space. They investigated the impact of scene content on perceptibility and acceptability tolerances in colour reproduction, as well as the use of different colour-difference formulae. Mahy et al. $ ^{27} $  investigated the use of a number of colour-difference formulae for image-processing purposes, concluding that it was impossible to detect differences among the results obtained using them. There were indications, however, that CIELAB gave more consistent results for colour differences of greater than 10 just-noticeable differences.

It might be thought that observers performing a colour-difference experiment of any type might be influenced by their inherent knowledge of colour. If two colours are perceived as differing in all three of the discrete colour components, hue, colourfulness, and lightness, then observers might scale the colour difference they perceive according to some weighted combination of the differences in those three separate components. Burns and Sheep $ ^{28} $  have shown, however, that observers respond to the overall lack of similarity between stimuli rather than to similarity itself, or lack of it, between the separate colour components. This was found to be true both for observers who had a good knowledge of the Munsell system of colour specification, and for those who had little knowledge of colour.

The purpose of the work described in this article was to investigate the applicability of colour-difference metrics as correlates of the results of the visual scaling of large colour differences.

## EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

## Preparation of Experimental Samples

Twenty-eight sets of uniform colour patches were photographically produced on colour printing paper. They were made using a colour printer with a facility to make stepped adjustments in red, green, and blue exposures. Using this facility, each of the 28 sets comprised a central reference colour with up to 48 hue and chroma variations about this reference: a ring-around set. (Note that a uniformly distributed set of exposures in the colour space of the printer will not, generally, yield as output a uniformly distributed set of colour patches in a colorimetric sense.) The printer had the ability to compensate automatically for the additional exposures made to give a near constant lightness output. There were, however, small variations within each set. The designation of the central colour of each of the 28 sets is shown in Table I. The use of this photographic technique to produce sets of coloured samples has been previously reported by Wood et al. $ ^{24} $ 

## Colorimetry of the Samples

In order to assess the relationship between the observers' scaled colour difference data and colour differences calculated from measurements, it was necessary to obtain the colorimetric data relating to each sample viewed. All measurements were made using a Gretag SPM-100 Spectro-Colorimeter, which uses  $ 45^{\circ}/0^{\circ} $  geometry and a 3.5-mm measuring aperture. CIE Standard Illuminant D65 and CIE 1931  $ 2^{\circ} $  Standard Observer were specified and CIE 1931 X, Y, Z tristimulus data were calculated. From these data CIELUV, CIELAB, CMC, and CIE1994 colour differences were determined. The

## Colour Scaling

A panel of 9 observers with normal colour vision was used to scale the colour difference between each member of a ring-around set and the reference patch. Colour difference scaling took place using a viewing booth in a darkened room. The level of illumination in the booth was approximately 1100 lux and the light source was provided by Artificial Daylight fluorescent lamps to give a correlated colour temperature of approximately 6500 K. The interior of the booth was painted mid-grey with 14% average reflectance. The method used to establish a reference scale interval was to provide each observer with two standard neutral patches, possessing a stipulated colour difference of 10 units, mounted in standard dark grey 35-mm.

slide mounts. These two patches were visible, together with the similarly presented reference colour patch throughout the scaling experiment. The perturbed patches, also presented in slide mounts, were then viewed, one at a time, and the colour difference between the sample and the ring-around reference was scaled by the observer, based on the reference scale interval provided. Up to 48 colour differences were scaled by each observer for each hue centre, the exact number depending on the hue. The use of slide mounts implies a minimum separation between colour patches of 15 mm.

## ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

The results for eleven hues were selected for analysis. In particular, the scaled values were examined as functions of colour differences expressed as four important metrics: CIELAB, CIELUV, CMC, and CIE1994,  $ \Delta E^{*} $  values. Graphs of all Set 1 data, Table I, of scaled colour differences plotted against  $ \Delta E^{*} $ , Fig. 1, showed a considerable spread of results about regression lines that did not pass through the origin. The regression statistics in Table III show that the highest correlation was obtained when  $ \Delta E^{*} $  CIE1994 was used as the colour-difference metric.

Luo and Rigg, $ ^{30} $  in their work on colour difference formulae, and Melgosa et al. $ ^{31} $  used a number of statistics both to evaluate and to optimize different equations. These statistics are defined in the Appendix. Table IV shows values of these statistics for the four colour-difference equations investigated in our work. The values for each of the statistics are, in all cases, higher than those obtained by Clarke et al. $ ^{32} $  in their earlier work leading to derivation of the CMC colour-difference formula. In order to investigate the distribution of experimental results shown in Fig. 1, the results for each colour centre were extracted and the scaled colour differences plotted against calculated values for each  $ \Delta E^{*} $  metric. In the case of the colour centre RED1, Fig. 2, the distribution of points about the regression line appeared systematic, with at least two readily identifiable data sets present. Examination of the actual colour patches showed a clear visual separation into two populations. This partitioning of the data was superimposed on a CIELAB  $ a^{*}, b^{*} $  diagram, Fig. 3, which shows that the visual separation coincided with a constant chroma boundary passing through the reference.

For completeness, the partitioning was also examined in a CIELAB  $ L^{*} $ ,  $ C^{*} $  diagram, Fig. 4, where the visual

separation additionally coincided with a constant  $ L^{*} $  boundary through the reference. These results suggested that the data for each colour ring-around should be partitioned as four quadrants centered on the reference.

In some cases, the population in one or more quadrants was too small for statistical analysis, as for RED1 quadrants 1 and 3, but the results for some other colour centres were more evenly distributed. The results of partitioning RED1 data are shown in Fig. 5. A cyan identified as CYN1 showed a more even distribution of results and was selected for further study. Linear regression analysis, partitioned according to the quadrants designated in Fig. 4, was carried out for scaled colour difference against CIE1994  $ \Delta E^{*} $  values as the most useful metric. The possible modes of partitioning data were explored for CYN1 and are illustrated in an  $ a^{*}, b^{*} $  diagram, Fig. 6, and a CIELAB  $ L_{ab}^{*} $  vs.  $ C_{ab}^{*} $  diagram, Fig. 7. Data partitioned according to Fig. 7 were used to establish four linear regressions for CYN1, Fig. 8. Regression statistics are shown in Table V for excursions from both RED1 and CYN1 colour centres.

## DISCUSSION

Inspection of Fig. 1 suggests that measured CIE1994 colour differences give the best linear fit to scaled colour difference values, for the overall Set 1 data. This is confirmed by the linear regression statistics shown in Table III, where the CIE 1994 $\Delta E^{*}$ scores the highest correlation, the highest $F$ ratio and the lowest residual standard deviation of all the metrics related to the scaled colour differences.

Linear regressions, Table IV, paralleling those of Fig. 1, but drawn using data partitioned by the quadrants drawn in Figs. 4 and 7, show much higher correlation coefficients when partitioned than when the data for the

Data partitioned by quadrants in an $L^{*}$ vs. $C^{*}$ diagram are, therefore, more reliably described by linear regression than the raw, larger, overall data sets.

1994 colour differences are calculated, the correlation,  $ r^{2} $ , is still only moderate.

These results indicate that visual scaling of a colour difference from a colour centre varies according to the direction of the excursion, from that centre, in colour space. This is demonstrated in terms of quadrants partitioned by lightness and chroma with the origin at the colour centre. The slopes for partitioned data differ according to the quadrant in a CIELAB  $ L^{*} $  vs.  $ C^{*} $  diagram, showing a tendency for quadrant 2 to give lower gradients than quadrant 4. Residual standard deviations are also shown. Table V, to be generally reduced for linear regressions drawn for the partitioned data than when data are combined for a colour centre.

The statistical advantages of partitioning the data into quadrants indicate that the individual quadrant populations are truly separate data populations. If this is the case, then the visual assessment of colour differences possesses a directionality depending on which of a pair of colours is regarded as the “reference.” Additionally, the stipulation of the reference in our experiments may have imposed an unsuspected artifactual element on the

relation between visual colour difference and calculated colour difference for large colour differences, within any of the colour spaces examined, and for CIELAB 1994 colour differences in particular. The issue of directionality, within a colour space, of judgments of difference between reproduction and original seems not to have been encountered before. The differences encountered between scaling behaviours found in the four identified  $ C^{*}L^{*} $  quadrants, Fig. 4, appear statistically reliable; they contribute to the overall spread of data about the regression line, observed when overall data are used in a plot of visual colour difference against calculated colour difference, Fig. 1, and indicate that caution is required in interpreting such apparently simple calibration data.

It is of interest that all the regressions relating visual colour difference to calculated colour difference, in this work, possess a positive intercept on the visual colour-difference axis. This implies that observers would moderately reliably scale a finite colour difference between identical samples. In general, the regression appears to describe the relation well at large colour differences but to fall down at small differences where a steeper relationship would appear to exist. It is not clear, at this stage, whether the effect is due to some mechanistic difference in the assessment of small and large colour differences, or is perhaps an artifact engendered by the physical separation of the samples by the neutral plastic surround of each.

## CONCLUSIONS

1. CIE 1994  $ \Delta E^{*} $  is the colour difference metric that correlated best with visual scaling of colour difference, under the conditions of the experiments carried out.

2. Visual colour scaling of colour difference appears to be dependent on the directionality of the difference, in colour space, between the reference and the test colour, under our experimental conditions.

3. The best linear correlations between scaled colour difference and CIE 1994  $ \Delta E^{*} $  were found when the difference data was partitioned according to quadrants, centred on the reference colour, in a CIELAB  $ L^{*} $  vs.  $ C^{*} $  diagram.

4. Linear regressions of visually scaled colour difference vs. CIE 1994  $ \Delta E^{*} $  found in this investigation possessed a positive intercept of approximately 2 visual units of colour difference. Observers, therefore, would

apparently perceive a colour difference between identical samples. The inherent unlikeliness of this deduction points to a significant difference between the visual scaling of small and large colour differences. Extrapolation of the linear relationship from large colour differences to small, or vice versa, is clearly difficult to justify without further clarification.

## FUTURE WORK

• An examination of more hues, Table I, is desirable, using the saturated, light and dark data sets as well as the data for the other colour centres at Value 5. This would enable examination of the possibility of hue and lightness dependency in the experimental results.

• Further investigation would, thus, involve a greater variation in lightness of test samples in line with the colour variation.

- Other proposed colour difference metrics could also be usefully compared with visually scaled colour difference.

- The transition from large to small colour differences should be investigated in greater detail. This would clarify the situation where the regression linking visual scaling with calculated colour differences does not pass through the origin.

## APPENDIX

The Performance Factor, PF, is a measure devised by Luo and Rigg $ ^{30} $  for evaluating the ability of different colour-difference formulae to predict the results of visual data sets. It is calculated using the following equation:

 $$ PF=100[\gamma+V_{AB}+(CV/100)-r], $$ 

where r represents the correlation coefficient, CV and  $ \gamma $  are measures proposed by Alder et al. $ ^{33} $  and  $ V_{AB} $  was derived by Schultze. $ ^{34} $  Alder et al. $ ^{33} $  defined the logarithm of  $ \gamma $  as the standard deviation of  $ \log(\Delta E/\Delta V) $ , and CV as

 $$ CV=\frac{100}{\overline{\Delta E}}\cdot\left(\frac{\Sigma(\Delta E-f\Delta V)^{2}}{n}\right)^{1/2}, $$ 

where f is the proportionality constant between  $ \Delta E $  and  $ \Delta V $  and is calculated as

 $$ f=\frac{\Sigma\Delta E\Delta V}{\Sigma\Delta V^{2}} $$ 

and n is the number of sample pairs. Schultze $ ^{34} $  defines a measure of the discrepancy,  $ V_{AB} $ , as

 $$ V_{A B}=\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum\frac{(\Delta E-F.\Delta V)^{2}}{\Delta E.F.\Delta V}\right)^{1/2}, $$ 

where

 $$ F=\left(\sum\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta V}\bigg/\sum\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta E}\right)^{1/2}. $$ 

Eliminating f gives

 $$ V_{A B}=\left[\frac{2}{n}\cdot\left(\sum\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta V}\sum\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta E}\right)^{1/2}-2\right]^{1/2}. $$ 

The PF measure combines four suitably weighted statistical measures of fit into one value. For perfect agreement,  $ \gamma $  should be equal to unity,  $ V_{AB} $  and CV to zero, and r to unity. Thus, the higher the value of PF, the worse the agreement between the predicted and the visual data.
